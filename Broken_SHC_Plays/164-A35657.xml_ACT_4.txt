I ever fear the prince too much greatness will make he less the great height be near the great precipice it|be in worldly accident as in the world itself where thing most distant meet one another thus the east and west upon the globe a mathematic point only divide thus happiness and misery and all extreme be still contiguous or if betwixt happiness and misery there be a distance it|be a airy vacuum nothing to moderate or break the fall but o this saintlike devil this damn caliph to make the king believe to kill his son be religion poor prince how be they mislead while they who sacred office it|be to bring king to obey their god and man their king by these mysterious link to fix and tie they to the footstool of the deity even by these man religion that shall be the curb be make the spur to tyranny they with their double key of conscience bind the subject soul and leave king unconfined while their poor vassal sacrifice their blood to|ambition and to avarice their good blind with devotion they themselves esteem make for themselves and all the world for they while heaven great law give for their guide appear just or unjust but as it wait on they use but to give the echo to their word power to their will and edge to their sword to varnish all their error and secure the ill they act and all the world endure thus by their art king awe the world while they religion as their mistress seem to|obey yet as their slave command she while they seem to rise to heaven they make heaven stoop to they nor be this all where feign devotion bend the high thing to serve the low end for if the many-headed beast have break or shake from his neck the royal yoke with popular rage religion do conspire flow into that and swell the torrent high then power first pedigree from force derive and call to mind the old prerogative of freeborn man and with a saucy eye search the heart and soul of majesty then to a strict account and censure bring the action error and the end of king tread on authority and sacred law yet all for God and his pretend cause act such thing for he which he in they and which themselves in other will condemn and thus engage nor safe can retire nor safe stand but blind bold aspire force their hope even through despair to climb to new attempt disdain the present time grow from disdain to threat from threat to arm while they though son of peace still sound the alarm thus whether king or people seek extreme still conscience and religion be their theme and whatsoever change the state invade the pulpit either force or persuade other may give the fuel or the fire but they the breath that make the flame inspire This and much more be true but let not we add to our ill and aggravate misfortune by passionate complaint nor lose ourselves because we have lose he for if the tyrant be to a son so noble so unnatural what will he be to we who have appear friend to that son Well think on and in time farewell unhappy prince while we thy friend as stranger to our country and ourselves seek out our safety and expect with patience heaven justice let|we rather act it then expect it the prince injury at our hand require more than our tear and patience his army be not yet disband and only want a head thither we|will fly and all who love the prince or hate the tyrant will follow we noble resolve and either we|will restore the prince or perish in the brave attempt you god since what we mean to execute be your high office to avenge the innocent assist we with a fortune equal to the justice of our action lest the world shall think itself delude and mistrust that you want will or power to be just it|be do and it|be my masterpiece to work my safety betwixt two dangerous extreme now like a skilful sailor have I pass Scylla and Charybdis I have escape the rock of steep ambition and the gulf of jealousy a danger less avoid because less fear what|be do my lord enough I warrant you imprison and deprive of sight no more this but provoke he can you think yourself secure and he alive the rest of|the business will do itself he can aswell endure a prison as a wild bull the net there let he struggle and toil himself to death and save we so much envy but if his father shall relent such injury can receive no excuse or colour but to be transfer upon his counselor and then the forfeiture of they redeem his error we must set a mark upon his passion and as we find it run low what ebb from he into our rage shall flow why shall we be more wicked than we must needs nay if you stick at conscience more gallant action have be lose for want of be complete wicked then have be perform by be exact virtuous it|be hard to be exact in good or excellent in ill our will want power or else our power want skill but gentleman be the king in earnest I can scarce believe it you will when you feel it I pray have any of you feel it to tell i what it be no sir but some of your fellow courtier can tell you that use something like it to mend their shape it|will make you so straight and slender Slender because I be slender in my wit must I be draw Slender in my waste I|will rather grow wise and corpulent Come sir it|be but a little stretch no no

sin of be a courtier and second the great sin one can commit in that place the speak of truth have you no more sin some few trifle more not worth the remember drink and whore and swear and such like but for those let they pass have you do now only some good counsel to the stander by we thank you for that sir nay gentleman mistake i not it|be not that I love you but because it|be a thing of course for die man let|we have it then First then if any of you be fool as I think that but a needless question be fool still and labour still in that vocation than the worst will be but whip where but for seem wise the best be rack but if you have the luck to be court fool those that have either wit or honesty you may fool withal and spare not but for those that want either you|will find it rather dangerous than otherwise I can give you a modern instance or two but let that pass but if you happen to be state fool then it|be but fool on the right side and all|be well than you shall at least be wise man fellow if not wise man master but of all thing take heed of give any man good counsel you see what I have get by it and yet like a fool must I be do on|it again be this all all but a little in my own behalf Remember gentleman I be at my full growth and my joint be knit and yet my sinew be not cable well we|will remember|it but stay gentleman what think you of a bottle now I hope you be more serious if you but know how dry a thing this sorrow be especial meet with my constitution which be as thirsty as any servingman let he have it it may be it|will make he confess yes I shall I shall lay before you all that|be within i and with most fluent utterance here|be to you all gentleman and let he that|be good nature in his drink pledge i So methinks I feel it in my joint already it make they supple now I feel it in my brain it make they swim as if the rack will be a shipwreck you be witty sir this be nothing but a poor clinch I have a thousand of they a trick I learn among the statesman hold sir you have no measure of yourself what do you talk of measure you|will take measure of i with a vengeance well rack I defy thou do thy worst I will thou be man giant or monster gentleman now if I happen to fall asleep upon this engine pray wake i not too sudden you see here|be good store of wine and if it be over-rack it|will come up with lees and all there I be with you again and now I be for you nature how do thou mock mankind to make he free and yet to make he fear or when he lose that freedom why do he not lose his fear that fear of fear the fear of what we know not while yet we know it be in vain to fear it death and what follow death it|be that that stamp a terror on the brow of king that give fortune her deity and Jove his thunder banish but fear of death those giant name of majesty power empire find nothing to be their object will be nothing too then he dare yet be free that dare to die may laugh at the grim face of law and scorn the cruel wrinkle of a tyrant brow but yet to die so tame overcome by passion and misfortune and still unconquered by my foe sound ill below the temper of my spirit yet to embrace a life so poor so wretched so full of death argue a great dulness but I be dead already nor can suffer more in the other world for what be hell but a long sleepless night and what|be their torment but to compare past joy with present sorrow and what can death deprive i of the sight of day of child friend and hope of empire and whatsoever other lose in death in life I be deprive of than I will live only to die revenge nor will I go down to the shade alone prompt i some witty some revengeful devil his devil that can make a bloody feast of his own son and call the god his guest here|be that can kill her age sire and cast her brother scatter limb to wolf and vulture or his that slay his father to enjoy his mother bed and great than all those my father devil Come mischief I embrace thou fill my soul and thou revenge ascend and bear the sceptre over all my other passion banish thence all that be cool and tame know old tyrant my heart|be too big to break I know thy fear exceed my suffering and my revenge though but in hope be much a great pleasure than thou can take in punish then my anger sink to the centre of my heart and there lie close in ambush till my seem patience have make the cruel tyrant as secure though with as little cause as now he|be jealous who|be there I find my nature will return to her old course I feel a inclination to some repose welcome thou please slumber a while embrace i in thy leaden arm and charm my careful thought conduct i to my bed how do the prince how bear he his restraint why sir as all great spirit bear great and sudden change with such impatience as a numidian lion when first catch endure the toil that hold he he will think of nothing but present death and seek all violent mean to compass it but time have mitigate those furious heat he now return to food and sleep admit the conversation of those that be about he I will I have not so easy believe my fear I be too sudden I will it be undo if you lament it that which now look like justice will be think a inconsiderate rashness but there be in nature such strong return that I punish he I do not grieve but that he be my son but it concern you to bear up your passion and make it good for if the people know that you have cause to grieve for what be do they|will think you have no cause at first to do it go visit he from i and teach he patience since neither all his fury nor my sorrow can help what|be past tell he my severity to he shall in some measure be requite by my indulgence to his child and if he desire it let they have access to he endeavour to take off his thought from revenge by tell he of paradise and I know not what pleasure in the other world I shall sir Mirvan the king relent and now there|be leave no refuge but the last he must be poison and sudden lest he survive his father but handsome lest it appear appear to who you know there|be none about he but such as I have place and they shall say it|be discontent or abstinence but at the best it|will be suspect why though|it be know we|will say he poison himself but the curious will pry further than bare report and the old king suspicion have pierce eye but those nature will short close you see his old disease grow strong upon he but if he shall recover but I have cast his nativity he can he must not in|the mean time I have so besiege he so block up all the passage and place so many sentinel and guard upon he that no intelligence can be convey but by my instrument but this business will require more head and hand then we go you to the prison and bring the keeper private to i to give he his instruction sir I be command by the king to visit you what to give a period to my life and to his fear you|be welcome here|be a throat a heart or any other part ready to let in death and receive his command my lord I be no messenger nor minister of death it|be not my function I shall know that voice I be the caliph and be come to tell you your father be now return to himself nature have get the victory over passion all his rigour be turn to grief and pity alas good man I pity he and his infirmity his doubt and fear and accident of age which first provoke his cruelty he bid i tell you his love to you shall ample recompense his cruelty to you and I dare say it|be real for all his thought his pleasure and delight be fix on Fatyma when he be sad she comfort he when sick she|be his physician and be it not for the delight he take in she I think he|will die with sorrow but how be his affection fix so strange on her alone sure it|be not in his nature for then he have love i or hate she because she come from i it|be her desert she|be fair beyond comparison and witty above her age and bear a manly spirit above her sex but may not I admire she be that too great a happiness pray let she make it her next suit to be permit to visit i herself she shall sir I joy to see your mind so well compose I fear I shall have find a tempest in your soul and come to lay it I|will to the king I know to he that news will be most acceptable pray do and tell he I have cast off all my passion and be now a man again fit for society and conversation I will sir I never know myself till now how on the sudden I|be grow a excellent dissembler to outdo one at the first that have practise it all his life so now I be myself again what be|it I feel within methinks some vast design now take possession of my heart and swell my labour thought above the common bound of humane action something full of horror my soul have now decree my heart do beat as if it|be forge thunderbolt for Jove to strike the tyrant dead so now I have it I have it it|be a gallant mischief worthy my father or my father son all his delight|vbz in Fatyma poor innocent but not more innocent than I and yet my father love thou and that|be crime enough by this act old tyrant I shall be quit with thou while I be virtuous I be a stranger to thy blood but now sure thou will love i for this horrid crime it be so like thy own in this I|be sure although in nothing else I be thy son but when it|be do I leave he yet that remedy I take myself revenge but I aswell will rob he of his anger as his joy and have send she to the shade I|will follow she but to return again and dwell in his dire thought for there|be the black hell sir your wife the princess be come to visit you conduct she in now to my disguise again be this my lord the prince that|be Erythaea or some angel voice like she it|be she my struggle soul will fain go out to meet and welcome she Erythaea no answer but in sigh dear Erythaea thou come to comfort to support my suffering not to oppress i with a great weight to see that my unhappiness involve thou too my lord in all your triumph and your glory you call i into all your joy and give i a equal share and in this depth of misery can I be unconcern you needs must know you needs must hope I can or which be worse you must suspect my love for what be love but sympathy and this I make my happiness since both can be happy that we can both be miserable I prithee do not say thou love i for love or find out equal or make they so but I be so cast down and fall so low I can rise to thou and dare not wish thou shall descend to i but call it pity and I will own it then that king may give to beggar and not lessen their own greatness till now I think virtue have stand above the reach of fortune but if virtue be not yet love a great deity whatever fortune can give or take love want not or despise or by his own omnipotence supply then like a god with joy behold the beauty of his own creation thus what we form and image to our fancy we real possess but can thy imagination delude itself to fix upon a object so lose in misery so old in sorrow paleness and death hang on my cheek and darkness dwell in my eye more change from what I be in person then in fortune yet still the same to i alas my lord these outward beauty be but the prop and scaffold on which we build our love which now make perfect stand without those support nor be my flame so earthy as to need the dull material fuel of eye or lip or cheek still to be kindle and blow by appetite or else to|expire my fire be pure and like those of heaven feed only and content with themselves need nothing from without but the disgrace that wait upon misfortune the mere reproach the shame of be miserable expose man to scorn and base contempt even from their near friend love be so far from scorn misery that he delight in|it and be so kind cruel sometime to wish it that he may be alone in stead of all of fortune honour friend which be but mere diversion from love proper object which only be itself thou have almost teach i to love my misery and forgive all my misfortune I|will at least forget they we will receive those time and in our memory preserve and still keep fresh like flower in water those happy day when at our eye our soul kindle their mutual fire their equal beam shoot and return till link and twine in one they chain our heart together And be it just that fortune shall begin her tyranny where we begin our love no if it have why be not I blind too I|be sure if weep can have do|it I have be think not that I be blind but think it night a season for our love and which to lover never seem too long and think of all our misery but as some melancholy dream which have awake we to the renew of our joy my lord this be a temper worthy the old philosopher ay but repeat that lesson which I have learn from thou all this morality thy love have teach i my lord you wrong your virtue to|ascribe the effect of that to any cause less noble than itself and you your love to think it be less noble or less powerful than any the best virtue but I fear thy love will wrong itself so long a stay will make the jealous king suspect we have be plot how do the pledge of our former love our child both happy in their grandsire love especial the pretty Fatyma yet she accord to her apprehension feel a sense of your misfortune but let she not too much express it lest she provoke his fury she only can allay it when it|be provoke she play with his rage and get above his anger as you have see a little boat to mount and dance upon the wave that threaten to overwhelm it to threaten be to save but his anger strike we like thunder where the blow outfly the loud report and even prevent man fear but then like thunder it rend a cedar or a oak or find some strong resist matter woman and child be not subject worthy a prince anger whatsoever be worthy of their love be worth their anger Love a more natural motion they be angry as prince but love as man once more I beg make not thy love thy danger my lord I see with what unwillingness you lie upon i this command and through your fare discern your love and therefore must obey you farewell my dear Erythaea there|be a strange music in her voice the story of Orpheus which appear so bold a fiction be prophesy of thou thy voice have tame the tiger and the lion of my soul sir your daughter Fatyma conduct she in how strange be I tempt with opportunity which like a sudden gust have swell my calm thought into a tempest accurse opportunity the midwife and the bawd to all our vice that work

froward child be rock asleep by reason or religion thou like a violent noise come rush in and make they wake and start to new unquietness Come hither pretty Fatyma thy grandsire darling sit upon my knee he love thou dear I father for your sake and for his sake I shall requite it o virtue virtue where be thou flee thou be my reason friend but that like a depose prince have yield his sceptre to

a conflict do I feel how be I toss like a ship betwixt two encounter tide love that be banish hence will fain return and force a entrance but revenge that|be now the porter of my soul be deaf deaf as the adder and as full of poison mighty revenge that single canst overthrow all those joint power which nature virtue honour can raise against thou what do you seek for your handkerchief pray use i to drink the bloody moisture from your eye I|will show|it my grandfather I know it|will make he weep why do you shake father just so my grandsire tremble at the instant your sight be take away and upon the like occasion o father what mean the naked knife it|be to requite thy grandsire love prepare to meet thy death o it|be I it|be I your daughter Fatyma I therefore do it Alas be this the blessing my mother send i to receive thy mother Erythaea there|be something in that that shake my resolution poor Erythaea how wretched shall I make thou to rob thou of a husband and a child but which be worse

fear not to encounter that giant my revenge alas poor Fatyma my father love thou so do Erythaea whether shall I by just plague he who I hate be more unjust cruel to she I love or be kind to she be cruel to myself and leave unsatisfied my anger and revenge but love thou be the noble passion and to thou I sacrifice all my ungentle thought Fatyma forgive i and seal it with a kiss what be|it I feel

high that may look down upon his threat my patience shall mock his fury nor shall he be so happy to make i miserable and my suffering shall erect a proud trophy to my name than all my prosperous action every pilot can steer the ship in calm but he perform the skilful part can manage it in storm
