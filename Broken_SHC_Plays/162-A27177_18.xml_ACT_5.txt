little splendour that he have from we and we be serve for fear not at entreaty we may live safe but till then we but walk with heavy burden on a sea of glass and our own weight will sink we your mother bring you into the world a emperor you persuade but what I will have counsel nearness of blood respect of piety and thankfulness and all the holy dream of virtuous fool must vanish into nothing

thou have none but by permission alas poor Charinus thou shadow of a emperor I scorn thou thou and thy foolish threat the god appoint he the absolute disposer of the earth that have the sharp sword I be sure Charinus thou wear one without edge when cruel Aper have kill Numerianus thy brother a act that will have make a tremble coward more dare than Alcides thy base fear make thou wink at it then rise up my uncle for the honour of the empire and of Rome against the traitor and among his guard punish the treason this bold dare act get he the soldier suffrage to be Caesar and howsoever his too gentle nature allow thou the name only as his gift I challenge the succession thou be cozen when the receiver of a courtesy can sustain the weight it carry with it it|be but a trial not a present act

tyranny but he will forsake his private life and once again resume his laid-by majesty or at least make choice of such a Atlas as may bear this burden too heavy for thy shoulder to effect this lend your assistance gentleman and then doubt not but that this mushroom spring up in a night shall as soon wither and for you Aurelia if you esteem your honour more than tribute pay to your loathsome appetite as a fury fly from his loose embrace so farewell ere long you shall hear more exeunt be you strike dumb that you make no reply sweet I will do and after talk I will prevent their plot and
