counterplot he will be greet with a affront shall cloud his entertainment and dim the paint glory of that pomp your compliment intend our youthful king must not direct our counsel nor affair of state be order by the|affection of one so weak in policy indulgent to his own passion Carthage be set down by our experience for numidia love and shall possess it we may then consider the carthaginian general be a man wear with employment into more decay of strength and year than can give any hope of a continuance Rome green champion be full of grow sap to make he spread while the other like a age oak that long have fight with tempest and withstand the rage of burn air now yield to every gust a bough or arm till one more violent shatter the dry limb or quite root it up it|be better to provide for last state then mere to prevent a present fate then Scipio must be welcome but if Syphax will hear our reason Crates you have be our worthy counsellor and by your wisdom steer government in a right course while yet our youth do want it but we be now grow Riper in judgement and we can distinguish to they messenger the different ground of any politic act nor do we find it safe in rule of state if Scipio be not welcome what|be your haste the roman general be arrive and enter and no feign thunder to inform we of it from the loud voice of flock multitude shall throng to bid he welcome he|be scarce know to any but myself his train be private without due state only some needful servant to wait upon his person be they his army I will exhaust my treasury to feast they and every common

congest to make he up a worthy I|will not answer your kindness Syphax with a compliment my tongue|be not oil with flattery I have steal a little time from action to inform numidia king how Rome by my advice have choose he a favourer of her cause that suffer by false Carthage the success of my recover Spain have give new hope unto her faint spirit that be near their last expire by the massacre the carthaginian make six consul have already fall my father and my uncle Sempronius Terentius and Flaminius and last Marcellus who receive his death even in the sight of Rome yet there|be a Scipio survive to conquer he or die in the|enterprise and that brave Scipio shall not want what aid my person or my kingdom can afford he Rome shall make great esteem of Syphax friendship and when she shall be wrap in silken wing of victory and peace his statue crown shall grace the triumph I shall rather joy to see he chain a captive though myself and family be sell to be his ransom in Carthage quarrel

Hannibal we be betray by Syphax what art Rome general and thy enemy ha Scipio then the character report give|we of he|be false he scorn ignoble way of honour to overcome by treachery I think the same of Hannibal and find it it|be only thy conspiracy with Syphax who make his court a privilege for that fame will proclaim with blush why this uproar Syphax thou|be treacherous to Rome and Scipio to Hannibal and Carthage now observe how he will calm the tempest what to answer from sudden doubt you both possess i with I can easy resolve a jealousy be sometime strengthen by the|excuse shall kill it

more to see thou Hannibal but rather arm in the field prepare for a encounter then here to parley doubt not such a greeting when next we meet I needs must interpose and moderate this contention pray my lord let i be powerful to dispose your temper for other mild impression that my court for entertain two such enemy at once be make discourse for after-age a banquet wait you music usher it music thus peace bid soldier welcome Syphax no think of Rome cause and let your feast be season with say to that if thou prove treacherous expect a vengeance justice never yet give severe execution to a great I must be go the|affair of war attend i when I have settle Rome peace we|will comply in the effect action till then must live by blood and labour Hannibal farewell next greeting will be rough not to be calm with word Grow strong be still a conqueror till I shall conquer thou thou be but flatter by a ambition vain than thy dream ten carthage and Hannibal will not weigh equal with the achievement one Hannibal and Carthage poise but in a equal scale with twenty Rome and twenty Scipio shall weigh like lead against feather proud insister upon his own slight merit Remember Syphax thy vow have make thou Rome which I|will preserve as sacred inviolate as if eternal seal have ratify it usher the roman general forth flourish exeunt have word such power upon our general to deject he thus my brain be labour I|will help to deliver it as giddy fancy when they do present delightful shadow seem to please the sense when it be quiet and not capable of any object till the dreamer joy

mean by which their master love must be regain a long experience confirm our friend then prosecute it thorough my lord till now the accident cause by the roman presence do prevent we from give satisfaction to your doubt which be but just ground our young king be full of|his youthful passion and so violent in|the prosecution of they counsel rather do set a keen edge upon his appetite we therefore give he way but if we can reduce his action to a rule of judgement we|will open oppose he or conspire as against a tyrant that make will his law see he|be return be confident how whisper I do suspect if Syphax dare be private dare Hannibal have thou intent more black than ever night give execution to even in Carthage senate house as well as in my own court I dare stand the|encounter of single Hannibal withdraw they must not the wrong thou have do Carthage must be witness that when fame speak they loud partial man make not their incredulity a excuse for what no satisfaction can restore thy honour lose in infamy thou tempt i with these dark preface yet thy upbraid do seem so frivolous my patience rather laugh at their vainness clear my understanding without more circumstance for yet my innocence Know not to accuse myself unless forgive thy saucy taunt a privilege what error but to defend itself will strive though vain to mock truth out of truth well Syphax know the expectation of a state delude can but trouble it a king be more than a mean person bound with dimension of the bare man his action be his people and what he do or suffer they must stand Consider then when Carthage shall call up revenge and with all force pursue the injury to satisfaction when her soldier who custom have make pitiless shall plough the womb of teem mother with their falchion to prevent the issue that may vindicate a father slay make your numidian virgin the ruin of their pleasure and not leave a altar to your god nor private lar that may defend a household from their violence when these who very repetition carry horror enough to fright man into peace shall happen when they shall it rather seem a positive threat Tell Carthage be her power of a extent that limit can not bind with any circumscription I|will not fear it to die for Rome be above victory furnish ten thousand choice numidian horseman to wait on Scipio why be our command no more respect I|will have
