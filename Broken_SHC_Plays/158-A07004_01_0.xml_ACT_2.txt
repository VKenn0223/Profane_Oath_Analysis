feed upon his soul some power divine or else infernal mix their angry seed at his conception for he be never spring of human race since with the spirit of his fearful pride he dare so doubtless resolve of rule and by profession be ambitious what God or fiend or spirit of the earth or monster turn to a manly shape or of what mould or metal he be make what star or state soever govern he let we put on our meet encounter mind and in detest such a devilish thief in love of honour and defence of right be arm against the hate of such a foe whether from earth or hell or heaven he grow noble

love soldier now to save your king and country from decay then strike up drum and all the star that make the loathsome circle of my date life direct my weapon to his barbarous heart that thus oppose he against the god and scorn the power that govern Persia barbarous and bloody Tamburlaine thus to deprive i of my crown and life treacherous and false Theridamas even at the morning of my happy state scarce be seat in my royal throne to work my downfall and untimely end a uncouth pain torment my grieve soul and death arrest the organ of my voice who enter at the breach thy sword have make sack every vain and artery of my heart bloody and insatiate Tamburlaine the thirst of reign and sweetness of a crown that cause the elder son of heavenly Ops to thrust his dote father from his chair and place himself in the imperial heaven move i to manage arm against they state what better precedent than mighty jove nature that frame we of four element war within our breast for regiment do teach we all to have aspire mind our soul who faculty can comprehend the wondrous architecture of the world and measure every wander planet course still climb after knowledge infinite and always move as the restless sphere will we to wear ourselves and never rest until we reach the ripe fruit of all that perfect bliss and sole felicity the sweet fruition of a earthly crown and that make i to join with Tamburlaine for he be gross and like the massy earth that move not upward nor by princely deed do mean to soar above the high sort and that make we the friend of Tamburlaine to lift our sword against the persian king for as when jove do thrust old Saturn down Neptune and Dis gain each of they a crown so do we hope to reign in Asia if Tamburlaine be place in Persia the strange man that ever nature make I know not how to take their tyranny my bloodless body wax chill and cold and with my blood my life slide through my wound my soul begin to take her flight to hell and summons all my sense to depart the heat and moisture which do feed each other for want of nourishment to feed they both be dry and cold and now do ghastly death with greedy talent gripe my bleed heart and like a harper tire on my life Theridamas and Tamburlaine I die and fearful vengeance light upon you both not all the curse which the fury breathe shall make i leave so rich a prize as this Teridamas Techelles and the rest who think you now be king of Persia Tamburlaine Tamburlaine though mar himself the angry god of arm and all the earthly potentate conspire to dispossess i of this diadem yet will I wear it in despite of they as great commander of the eastern world if you but say that Tamburlaine shall reign long live Tamburlaine and reign in Asia So now it be more sure on my head than if the god have hold a parliament and all pronounce i king of Persia
