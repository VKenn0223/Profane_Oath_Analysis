to content you and will part even with my be both might have their wish but since that be impossible in few word I will deliver what I be resolve on the end for which all profitable law be make look two way only the reward of innocent good man and the punishment of bad delinquent we concern rape provide that same latter clause of marriage for he that have fall once not then foresee mankind can prove so monstrous to tread twice a path so horrid the great lawgiver Draco that for his strange severity be say to write his stern decree in blood make none for parricide presume that no man can be so wicked such may be Lycurgus answer do he live for this but since I find that in my son which be not doubt in any else I will add to it he can marry both but for both die both have their full revenge you see Beliza you have your wish with you Merione I|will spend a tear or two so heaven forgive thou upon my knee I do approve your judgement and beg that you will put it into act with all speed possible only that I may have already make peace with myself part so with all the world princely Agenor I ask your pardon you my lord Euphanes and Crates with the rest too I forgive you do you the like for i you gracious mother I dare not ask and yet if that my death be like a son of you though my life be not perhaps you may vouchsafe it last that both these who I have wrong may wish my ash

afterward revoke it be full bend to match she with Agenor the grieve prince know this and yet not dare to cross what you determine by a oath bind i and these his follower to do something that he may once enjoy she we swear to it and easy persuade be assure she be his wife before the face of heaven although some ceremonious form be want commit the first rape and bring she to he which break the marriage but when we perceive he purpose to abuse our ready service in the same kind upon the chaste Beliza hold ourselves less tie to he then goodness I make discovery of it to my brother who can relate the rest it be most true I will it be in every circumstance it be upon my soul for this know to i I win Merione in my lady habit to be again but willing surprise but with Agenor and her noble brother with my approve friend Conon with such speed she be pursue that the lewd act scarce end the prince assure he have enjoy Beliza for all the time Meriones face be cover be apprehend and bring to
