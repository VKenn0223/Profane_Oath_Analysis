that gain it back without my will your justice must restore it will your severe majesty triumph with soft spoil of a lady cabinet as I will not feign favour and belie a jewel or a twist to gain the name of creature or of servant unto any so by your beauty for if Persian may swear by their sun I well may swear by that where honour be transmit in a true mysterious gage of a immaculate mind I will defend it as some sacred relic or some more secret pledge drop down from heaven to guard i from the danger of the earth but in that you make it common you bereave it of all that you call divinity he that vaunt of a receive favour ought to be punish as sacrilegious person be because he do violate that sacred thing pure spotless honour but it may be see and yet not prostitute I will not smother my joy and make my happiness a stealth how your thought flatter your deceive fancy into a state that when you leave to think die as your thought that keep it up what be|it that you call joy and happiness I must confess I have no merit who just heat may extract aught from you call love yet when I do consider that affection can look virtuous on any thing that be resplendent but a subtle image pure reflect thence must needs arise and pay that look again I do take leave to say the careful deity provide that love shall never be so unhappy as to want his brother why I never spend a sigh for you you never have a kiss nor the reversion of one yet such love be but Love idol and these soft one that confine it to a kiss or a embrace do as the superstitious do of old contract the godhead into a bull or goat or some such lustful creature be it far be|it far from i to think wherever I see clear stream of beauty that I may presume to trouble they with quench of my thirst where a full splendour where a bright effusion of immaterial beam do meet to make up one body of perfection I shall account myself injurious unto that deity which have let down himself into those ray if that I shall draw nigh without a awful adoration which my religion pay to you but be you like not the devotion be content to slight the sacrifice but spare the altar I be so far from ruine that breast in which there live a spark of chaste honour that I will hazard this so prize a trifle which man call life that I may live there still and prove that love be but a engine of the careful power invent for the safety and preservation of afflict goodness conceive not hence a passion burn towards you for she that speak like woman be a queen I can distinguish betwixt love and love between flame and good intent nay between flame and flame themselves the gross now fly up and now fall down again still covet new matter for food consume and consume but the pure clear flame that shoot up always in one continue pyramid of lustre know no commerce with earth but unmixed still and still aspire upward if that may be call aspire which be nature have this property of immortality still to suffice themselves neither devour and yet devour and such I knowledge you on which I look as on refine idea that know no mixture or corruption be one eternal simpleness that these shall from the circle of their chaste glory dart out a beam on i be far beyond all humane merit and I may conclude they|have only their own nature for a cause and that they|be good they be diffusive too your tongue have speak your thought so noble that I bear a pity to your virtue which ere night shed poppy twice over the|weary world must only be in these two register annal and memory can you but contrive how you may live without a injury unto religion you shall have this glory to have a queen your instrument there|be nothing can woo my heart unto a thought of life but that your presence will be want to i when I|be shut up in silence yet I have a strong ambition in i to maintain a equal faith betwixt Greece and Persia that like a river run betwixt two field I may give growth and verdure unto both Praxaspes and masiste potent lord be both against my design so that I shall not obtain a army for they think I have that vile mind in i to betray this kingdom to which I|have swear fidelity when by yourself by all that|be good my intent be only to perfect great Arsamnes conquest and in that be beneficial to my country in which if that your majesty will descend to act a part after the scene be shut I|will down to Elysium with a joyful mind and teach our grecian poet your bless name and virtue for a everlasting song be it against myself I|will not deny it walk in I|will follow you in great design Ex. Crat. valour help much but virtuous love do more wase not enough that you peruse his action and surfeit your eye upon his folly see and see again but you must cast he a chain a emblematic chain it|be not the veil that hinder the quick busy eye from read over the face but modesty he have a weak defence that do entrust the preservation of a chaste love unto a silken cloud I stand not much upon the commerce of your eye but it|be your chain your favour that do|you think it|be fit a queen shall send one link unto a slave do not the sun the sun which yet you worship send beam to other than yourself yet those which dwell on you lose neither light nor heat come not thence less vigorous or less chaste will you seal up a fountain or confine the air unto your walk will you enjoin the flower to cast no smell but as you pass love be as free as fountain air or flower for|it stand not in a point it|be large and may like stream give verdure to this plant that tree nay that whole field of flower and yet still run in a most faithful course towards the bosom of the love ocean but when you divert and break the stream into small rivulet you make it run more weak then when it keep unite in one channel if it branch into a small twine here and there the water be not lose nor do it quit the former name this be not to destroy but to enlarge the stream do it dry up and leave the fountain destitute indeed you|will reason to be angry but what shall make you present he with a gift you may have smother a good opinion of he in your breast as some digress stream flow under ground and so have rest but you show it now and make the world partaker who will stifle a honest fire that flame|be to be suspect that hide itself when that a man of valour grace his country with a good attempt you give a sword a horse a manor nay sometime a whole province for reward we have a sense of virtue too as well as you and shall we be deny the liberty to show we have that sense a favour be the alm of love I do not pass away my heart in charity virtuous Cratander show forth so full a transcript of your life in all but his misfortune that methinks you may admire yourself in he as in your shade but yet let chaste Atossa rather not be at all than not be whole you thou be still virtuous my Atossa still transparent as thy crystal but more spotless fool that we be to think the eye of love must always look on we the vine that climb by conjugal embracement about the elm may with a ring or two perhaps encircle some neighbour bough and yet this twine prove not the offence but charity of love I do state wink in that case divine Come thou uneven lump thou heap of sin in proof we will liquor thy key open thy cage and give thy meager tenant a play day rascal bring the jar near as I hope for fortune I think my soul will pass into a frog now for a hundred throat to thou Molops you grecian I think have sponge in your maw it|be but set your hand to your side and squeeze yourselves and present you drink as much as before off with thy cup landlord and talk not we learn it from the teat fool have at thou Archippus I do not like these health at random let|we have a sober methodical order for a while what shall we drink by dice then and let fortune name the heir to the cup or shall we drink our mistress name and soak it alphabetical if we drink name let not the letter pass for single one but as they will in number I do pronounce Alpha no letter till it begin to multiply I never think drink such a mystery before a blockhead can|it be drink I see right shallow brain can never attain to|it that make your fool and your old govern philosopher continue so sober still the veget artist and the vigorous poet who brain be full and forge still will straight get a pleasant madness from that that will but warm those cold rheumatic sage who nose always drop like still-snout the noble drink methinks be the posture let|we have|they bring the pot in play but where|be the wench and the music you promise we good Molops for wench the town will not yield any at this time and I dare not venture my single wife among you all for fiddler I have provide they they stand ready without call they in sweet Molops well what shall those rascal play while we drink the posture the battle by all mean strike up the battle then think yourselves all in service now and do as I do have towards thou Philotas to thou Archippus here Molops have at you fiddler now draw your bow and let loose all the other charge good fellow soldier let|we have a song between and then have at you fiddler employ your throat and sing a while you shall drink with they after sing that which I make in the prison it|be seasonable enough well say now the other charge to the honour of Cratander I feel a rumble in my head as if the Cyclops be forge thunder in my brain but no matter give it i our ancient Orpheus say it perpetual drunkenness be the reward of virtue out you dissemble rascal be you of cratander faction good gentleman do kick i I shall leave all my drink behind i if you do troth he|be so proud now he must be kill to make a supper for the immortal cannibal that there|be no ho with he I never think he will have be either so womanish as to have be chaste himself or so uncivil as to keep we so but he talk of lie with surprise city and commit fornication with victory and make mar pimp for he these be the fruit of learning we suffer all this mere because he have a little familiarity with the devil in philosophy and can conjure with a few notion out of Socrates in good troth I take it very scurvy at his hand that he will not let i deserve hang I|will thought to have do all the villainy in the world and leave a name behind i but he|be severe forsooth and cry out virtue mistress virtue disease take she I never know any good she do in commonwealth yet I wonder how he dare be so impudent as to be good in a strange place what star be thou bear under Stratocles agree agree agree agree agree agree the motion|be worthy crown the goblet then liberty
