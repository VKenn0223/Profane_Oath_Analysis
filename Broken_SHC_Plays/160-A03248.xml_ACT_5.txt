our innocence you have disloyal seek to exceed the king your sovereign and his royal deed to blemish which your fellow peer thus construe that strengthen by the|alliance of the king and better arm by the people love you may prove dangerous in policy of state to quench the spark before they grow to flame and top your height before your spacious branch spread too far what to this general motion can you say before we tax you with particular with reverence to the state before which I stand that you my lord of Chester appear shallow to think my action can disgrace the king as if the luster of a petty star shall with the moon compare alas my deed confer with he be like a candle light to outshine the midday glory can the king the glorious mirror of all gratitude condemn that virtue in another bosom which in his own shine so transparent o pardon i mere virtue be my end who pitch the king do many time transcend to tax you more succinct you have first abuse the king in send to the court your daughter less fair and the least belove and that include contempt most barbarous which you in that unsubject-like express your former emulation we omit as thing that may find tolerable excuse and be indeed not matter capital but to the best and great when the king out of his bounty and magnificence vouchsafe to style thou with the name of son be but a subject with contort brow and look of scorn you take his courtesy and in contempt send back the princess dower most true a ground proposition to question you of life my life my lord it please i that the king in person deign to grace my cause

allow as have their inward heart draw in their brow be there in all that bench a man so honest that can in this be discontent with i I charge you all those favour I receive from his high majesty I swallow not with greedy appetite perhaps like you when I be grace it come with awe and fear lest I offend that prince that hold i dear that for my brow but for your scornful send of the fair princess dower back to the king how can you answer that why Chester thus I be a man though subject if the mean lord over his wife why shall that privilege be only bar i shall I wive a empress and take her dowerless shall we love or hate in that my bounty equal her estate witness that judge above you I esteem the princess dear and yet marry she but as my wife for which I be infinite bind to the king why shall I grow engage above my power since this my lord you know the less we run in debt the less we owe give i my thought and score you on I pray I wish no more than I have mean to pay shall we my lord his action censure free and sentence they a persian history I read of late how the great sophy once fly a noble falcon at the Herne in come by chance a eagle souse by which when the hawk espy leave

courage she be peerless hold the emperor after some deliberate thought make he no less he cause a crown of gold to be new frame and fit to her head in honour of her courage then the bird with great applause be to the marketplace in tri triumph bear where when her utmost worth have be proclaim the common executioner first by the king command take off her crown and after with a sword strike off her head as one no better than a noble traitor unto the king of bird this use we make from this your ancient persian history that you a noble and a courteous peer praise for your hospital virtue and
