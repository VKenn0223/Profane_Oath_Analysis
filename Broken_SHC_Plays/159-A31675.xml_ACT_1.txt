Englishman thou be too hot at hand too shallow brain to undermine my throne the spanish sun have purify my wit and dry up all gross humour in my head that I be sight as the king of bird and can discern thy deep Stratagem I be the lawful German emperor choose install by general consent and they may term i tyrant as they please I will be king and tyrant if I please for what be empire but a tyranny and none but child use it otherwise of seven elector four be fall away the other three I dare not great trust my wife be sister to my enemy and therefore wise to be deal withal but why do I except in special when this position must be general that no man live must be credit further than tend unto thy proper good but to the purpose of my silent walk within this chamber lie my secretary Lorenzo de cipres in who learned brain be all the compass of the world contain and as the ignorant and simple age of our forefather blind in their zeal receive dark answer from Apollo shrine and honour he as patron of their bliss so I not muffle in simplicity zealous indeed of nothing but my good have to the augur of my happiness to lay the ground of my ensue war he learn his wisdom not by flight of bird by pry into sacrifice beast by hare that cross the way by howl wolf by gaze on the starry element or vain imaginary calculation but from a settle wisdom in itself which teach to be void of passion to be religious as the ravenous wolf who love the lamb for hunger and for prey to threaten our inferior with our look to flatter our superior at our need to be a outward saint a inward devil these be the lecture that my master read this key command all chamber in the court now on a sudden will I try his wit I know my come be unlooked for nay sleep Lorenzo I will walk a while as nature in the frame of the world ordain there shall be nihil vacuum even so methinks his wisdom shall contrive that all his study shall be full of wit and every corner stuff with sentence what|be this Plato Aristotle tush these be ordinary it seem this be a note but new write what be there thief within the emperor court villain thou die what make thou in my chamber how now Lorenzo will thou slay thy lord I do beseech your sacred majesty to pardon i I do not know your grace lie down Lorenzo I will sit by thou the air be sharp and pierce tremble not have it be any other but ourselves he must have be a villain and a thief alas my lord what mean your excellence to walk by night in these so dangerous time have I not reason now to walk and watch when I be compass with so many foe they ward they watch they cast and they conspire to win confederate prince to their aid and batter down the eagle from my crest o my Lorenzo if thou help i not the imperial crown be shake from my head and give from i unto a english earl thou know how all thing stand as well as we who be our enemy and who our friend who must be threaten and who dally with who win by word and who by force of arm for all the honour I have do to thou now speak and speak to purpose in the cause nay rest thy body labour with thy brain and of thy word myself will be the scribe why then my lord take paper pen and ink write first this maxim it shall do you good the fox be subtle but he want force the lion strong but scorn policy I|will imitate Lysander in this point and where the lion hide be thin and scant I|will firm patch it with the fox fall let it suffice I can be both in one tush fear not i my promise be sound but he that trust they shall be sure to fail nay my good lord but that I know your majesty to be a ready quickwitted scholar I will bestow a comment on the text then must I watch the palatine of the Rhein I cause his father to be put to death your highness have as little cause to trust the dangerous mighty duke of Saxony you know you seek to banish he the land and as for Collen be not he the first that send for Richard into Germany what|be thy opinion of the other four that Bohemia neither care for one nor other but hope this deadly strife between you twain will cast the imperial crown upon his head for trier and Brandenburg I think of they as simple man that wish the common good and as for Mentz I need not censure he Richard have chain he in a golden bond and save his life from ignominious death let it suffice Lorenzo that I know when churfurst Mentz be take prisoner by young victorious otho duke of Braunschweig that Richard earl of Cornwall do disburse the ransom of a king a million to save his life and ride he out of band that sum of gold do fill the Braunschweig bag but since myself have rain a golden shower of bright hungarian ducat and crusado into the private coffer of the bishop the english angel take their wing and flee my cross bless his coffer and plead for i his voice be i buy with ten tun of gold and at the meeting of the seven elector his princely double-dealing holiness will spoil the english emperor of hope but I refer these matter to the sequel proceed Lorenzo forward to the next I|be glad your grace have deal so cunning 4. it|be more safety for a prince to be fear than love love be a humour please he that love let i be hate so I please myself love be a humour mild and changeable but fear ere grave a reverence in the heart but my Lorenzo that|be the hard point it be not for a prince to execute physician and apothecary must know and service fear or counsel-breaking bribe will from a peasant in a hour extort enough to overthrow a monarchy therefore my lord set down this sixth and last article 6. be always jealous of he that know your secret and therefore it behoove you credit few and when you grow into the least suspect with silent cunning must you cut they off as for example julio Lentulus a most renown neapolitan give i this box of poison it|be not long but therewithal I send he to his grave and what|be the special virtue of the same that it be twenty day before it work but what be this This a infection that kill sudden this but a toy to cast a man asleep how be drink no be smell unto then smell Lorenzo I do break thy sleep and for this time this lecture shall suffice what have you do my lord you|have make i safe for stir hence these four and twenty hour I see this charm his sense sudden how now Lorenzo half asleep already Aeneas pilot by the god of dream be never lull into a sound trance and now Alphonsus overread thy note these be already at my finger end and lest the world shall find this little schedule thus will I rend the text and after this on my behaviour set so fair a gloss that man shall take i for a convertite but some may think I shall forget my part and have be over rash in rent it to put they out of doubt I study sure I|will make a backward repetition in be jealous of my counsel keeper this be the poison that kill sudden so do thou unto julius Lentulus and blood with blood must be requite thus now be I safe and no man know my counsel churfurst of Mentz if now thou play thy part earn thy gold with cunning workmanship upon the bemish king ambition Richard shall shameful fail of his hope and I with triumph keep my empery churfurst and prince of the election since by the adverse fortune of our age the sacred and imperial majesty have be usurp by open tyranny we the seven pillar of the German empire to who successive it do belong to make election of our emperor be here assemble to unite a new unto her former strength and glorious type our half decline roman monarchy and in that hope I Henry king of Bohemia churfurst and sewer to the emperor do take my seat next to the sacred throne next seat belong to julius Florius archbishop of Mentz chancellor of Germany by birth the duke of fruitful Pomerland the next place in election long to i George Cassimirus palsgrave of the Rhein his highness taster and upon my knee I vow a pure sincere innate zeal unto my country and no wrest hate or private love shall blind my intellect brave duke of saxon Dutch-land great hope stir now or never let the spanish tyrant that have dishonour we murder our friend and stain this seat with blood of innocent at last be chastise with the saxon sword and may Albertus archbishop of Collen chancellor of Gallia and the four elector be think unworthy of his place and birth but he assist thou to his utmost power wisdom not word must be the sovereign salve to search and heal these grievous fester wound and in that hope Augustus duke of saxon arch-marshal to the emperor take my place the like do Frederick archbishop of trier duke of Lorraine chancellor of Italy the seven and last be joachim Carolus marquis of Brandenburg overwear with age who office be to be the treasurer but war have make the coffer like the chair peace bring plenty war bring poverty grant heaven this meeting may be to effect establish peace and cut off tyranny pardon my bold intrusion mighty Churfurst and let my word pierce deep in your heart o I beseech you on my bend knee I the poor miserable empress a stranger in this land unused to broil wife to the one and sister to the other that be competitor for sovereignty all that I pray be make a quiet end make peace between my husband and my brother o think how grief do stand on either side if either party chance to be miss my husband be my husband but my brother my heart do melt to think he shall miscarry my brother be my brother but my husband oh how my joint do shake fear his wrong if both shall die in these uncertain broil o i why do I live to think upon|it bear with my interrupt speech lord tear stop my voice your wisdom know my meaning alas I know my brother Richard heart affect not empire he will rather choose to make return again to Palestine and be a scourge unto the infidel as for my lord he be impatient the more my grief the lesser be my hope yet prince thus he send you word by i he will submit himself to your award and labour to amend what be amiss all I have say or can device to say be few word of great worth make unity madam that we have suffer you to kneel so long agree not with your dignity nor we thus we excuse it when we once be set in solemn council of election we may not rise till somewhat be conclude so much for that touch your earnest sure your majesty do know how it concern we comfort yourself as we do hope the best but tell we madam where|be your husband now I leave he at his prayer good my lord at prayer madam that|be a miracle undoubted your highness do mistake it|be sure some book of conjuration I think he never say prayer in his life ah i my fear I fear will take effect your hate to he and love unto my brother will break my heart and spoil the imperial peace my lord of saxon and prince palatine this hard opinion yet be more than needs but gracious madam leave we to ourselves I go and heaven that hold the heart of king direct your counsel unto unity now to the depth of that we have in hand this be the question whether the king of Spain shall still continue in the royal throne or yield it up unto Plantagenet or we proceed unto a three election ere such a viperous bloodthirsty Spaniard shall suck the heart of our nobility the imperial sword which Saxony do bear shall be unsheathe to war against the world my hate be more than word can testify slave as he be he murder my father prince Richard be the champion of the world learned and mild fit for the government and what have we to do with Englishman they be divide from our continent but now that we may orderly proceed to our high office of election to you my lord of Mentz it do belong have first voice in this imperial synod to name a worthy man for emperor it may be think most grave and reverend prince that in respect of diverse sum of gold which Richard of mere charitable love not as a bribe but as a deed of alm disburse for i unto the duke of Braunschweig that I dare name no other man but he or shall I nominate another prince upon the contrary I may be think a most ingrateful wretch unto my friend but private cause must yield to public good therefore methinks it be the fit course to choose the worthy upon this bench we be all german why shall we be yoke either by Englishman or Spaniard the earl of Cornwall by a full consent be send for out of England though he be our late thought be pure than our first and to conclude I think this end be best since we have once choose he emperor that some great prince of wisdom and of power who countenance may overbear his pride be join in equal government with Alphonsus your holiness have sound in few word set down a mean to quiet all these broil so may we hope for peace if he amend but shall prince Richard then be join with he why shall your highness ask that question as if a prince of so high kingly birth will live in couple with so base a cur prince palatine such word do ill become thou he say but right and call dog a dog his birth be princely his manner villainous and virtuous Richard scorn so base a yoke my lord of saxon give i leave to tell you ambition blind your judgement in this case you hope if by your mean Richard be emperor he in requital of so great advancement will make the long-desired marriage up between the prince of England and your sister and to that end Edward the prince of Wales have bear his uncle company to Germany why king of Bohemia be|it unknown to thou how oft the saxon son have marry queen and daughter king yea mighty emperor if Edward like her beauty and behaviour he|will make no question of her princely birth but let that pass I say as erst I say that virtuous Richard scorn so base a yoke if Richard scorn some one upon this bench who power may overbear Alphonsus pride be to be name what think you my lord I think it be a mighty mass of gold that make your grace of this opinion my lord of Saxony you wrong i much and know I high scorn to take a bribe I think you scorn indeed to have it know but to the purpose if it must be so who be the fit man to join with he first with a ox to plough will I be yoke the fit be your grace in my opinion I be content to stay these mutiny to take upon i what you do impose why here|be a tempest quick overblow God give you joy my lord of half the empire for i I will not meddle in the matter but warn your majesty to have a care and vigilant respect unto your person I|will hie i home to fortify my town not to offend but to defend myself have with you cousin and adieu my lord I be afraid this sudden knit peace will turn unto a tedious last war only thus much we do request you all deal honourable with the earl of Cornwall and so adieu I like not this strange farewell of the duke in all election some be malcontent it do concern we now with speed to know how the competitor will like of this and therefore you my lord archbishop of trier impart this order of arbitrament unto the emperor bid he be content to stand content with half or lose the whole my lord of Mentz go you unto prince Richard and tell he flat here|be no crown nor empire for english islander tell he it|be he best to hie he home to help the king his brother against the earl of Leicester and the baron my lord of Mentz sweet word will qualify when bitter term will add unto his rage it|be no small hope that have deceive the duke therefore be mild I know a Englishman be flatter be a lamb threaten a lion tell he his charge what so ever they be shall|be repay with treble vantage do this we will expect their resolution brother of Collen I entreat your grace to take this charge upon you in my stead for why I shame to look he in the face your holiness shall pardon i in this have I the profit I will take the pain with shame enough your grace may bring the message thus be I wrong God know unguilty then arm your countenance with innocency and bold do the message to the prince for no man else will be the messenger why then I must since there|be no remedy if heaven that guide the heart of mighty man do calm the wind of these great potentate and make they like of this arbitrament sweet peace will triumph through Christendom and Germany shall bless this happy day o i most miserable o my dear father what mean this passionate accent what be thou that sound
