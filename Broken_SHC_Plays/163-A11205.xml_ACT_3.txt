madam sure it be impossible you shall find any thing there worth your love thou know the shepherd that do dwell about this place which for their entertainment only the king my father build do use to come as now they do be send for unto court I ever like their sport their harmless mirth and their contention which be void of malice and wish I have be bear just such a one but I confess the rather cause there be one among they of a more comely grace though none of they do seem uncomely to i call Thyrsis and with he methinks I can draw out my life rather than any other such thing my fancy then suggest to i so well he sing so passionate his love show in his verse thereto so well express as any one will judge it natural yet never feel he flame till this of i often he come and often be desire of i nor do I shame in public there before my father to commend his grace which when I do the whole court as they use consent with i and do strive to make they great than I or any else can think they at last I be surprise I can not help it my fate with love consent so will have it then do I leave the court I|have tell thou all it|be strange but madam though in that disguise how can you hope a stranger to be love of he you hold so dear I feign myself of Smyrna and from thence some goat I have and sheep with they a rich commodity near he I buy i land to feed they he seem glad of it and think i a stranger use i with such civility and friendship as one will little look for of a shepherd and do defend i from the avarice of the old shepherd which do think to make a prey of what I have at length I see he do address himself with fear to i still gaze on i know my love to he I easy believe he love i too for love alas be ever credulous and though I be resolve have my end which be no more than to discourse with he never to let he know what flame I feel yet when I see his tear and hear his vow persuasive speaker for affection I can not choose but open to his view my love heart yet with this caution that he shall ever bear respect unto my honour and my virgin chastity which than he vow and his ambition never be more than to attain a kiss which yet he hardly get thou see sweet Delia how willing I dwell upon this theme but can thou help i now that I have open my wound unto thou Alas I will I can invent the way to cure you I shall soon apply my help yet stay this day it be the shepherd come to court it|be true they come but what be that to i if Thyrsis come not or if he come how shall he know i he or I enjoy his company let i alone to work out that I|will undertake it but how shall I know he without inquire which must breed suspicion true and beware thou ask the majesty which sit upon his brow will say it|be he Thyrsis my love but yet perhaps at this time if I myself not flatter thou shall know he by his eye cast down and fold of his arm and often sigh that interrupt his word for if his sorrow wear the livery which mine do for his absence by these sign thou shall descry he these be silent mark yet will I not despair to find he out but when thou have what will thou say to he give i but leave to use my mother wit you will be go together will you not thou speak my thought do this and I will crown thy faith thou shall be queen instead of i if you can crown i with your virtue madam I shall be a queen indeed in the mean time as I be Delia I|will do this business do it and when the have do the god of love reward thou with thy own desire for this sir you have put a bridle on my passion and give my soul the liberty it wish I now entreat your pardon for begin a thing of so great consequence without leave and advice from you it|be well Cleander it will behoove you then to be reserve and lock this secret up for it|be no jest with king that may command our life and fortune you now perceive she who we call the princess to be your sister and the love you bear she must be a brother friendship not a lover passionate heat but yet she must not know that I her father be and you her brother and trust i son have I not see despair of life in you which this love bring you too I shall not have reveal what now you know it be a comfort sir I do confess that come in time to rescue i from death so great her scorn be and my love so violent I be but if I be too curious in ask where the king son be I shall desire your pardon for sure it be injustice to deprive so great a prince of that which he be bear too you be too far inquisitive yet because I have engage you in a secret of as great importance this I will not hide the king I tell you when his wife grow near the time of her delivery send to know of our great oracle whether the child shall be female or male and what shall be their fortune it only be impart unto i and this it be which I have never show to any but the queen here take and read it if ere thy issue male thou live to see the child thou think be thou thou shall not be his life shall be obscure twice shall thy hate doom he to death yet shall he escape that fate and thou shall live to see that not long after thy only son shall wed thy only daughter this oracle be full of mystery it be and yet the king will needs interpret that shall it prove a man-child it|be a bastard and be loath that one not of his blood as he conceive by this shall be his heir tell i in private that if it be male he will not have it live yet fear most to publish his dishonour and his wife he charge i not reveal it unto any but take the child and see it make away and make the world believe it be still bear no for indeed I dare not for any thing become a murderer I go unto the queen show she the state she be in and beseech she to be as careful of i as I be of she and we will work a better end than she expect so we both agree that if the child she then do labour with prove to be male I shall with care conceal the birth of it and put a female child instead of it which I be to look out it fortune that your mother then be ready to be deliver of your sister and time and good fortune do conspire to save the king child and to make my daughter princess the queen protest to i that it be the king own child conjure i to preserve it which as my own I can not for already many take notice that my child be female and therefore I be fain to publish she as dead and bury a empty coffin I ride forth with the child a full night journey with purpose to deliver it to some plain honest man that will be careful of it and not inquisitive to know who child it be but give it breed as his own when be fright with the noise of arm of some outlawed thief that do infest the place I make all haste I can to escape they consider my charge for that I know if I be take though they spare my life the charge I have must needs betray i to the king and then I can not hope for mercy I lay it down there cover close over a circle about his neck wherein be write in character know only to myself and to the king in which I use to clothe secret dispatch when I write to he from foreign state and within the circle I grave the king less seal which then I keep some gold beside and jewel there I leave that whosoever shall find he may with that defray the charge of his education however next day I purpose to return with speed and carry it to some abode she do not till my return next day then when I tell she the child be thence remove where I have leave he how can the queen take this so sad a story with such impatience that be weak before she short die but yet sir with your favour may you not have make inquiry after he I dare not for fear of be discover on your life take heed how you reveal this then let we watch my daughter for I fear the flight she make be for some other end then for retirement which she do pretend henceforth I shall obey she as my
