my love dear Otho fain will bid thou stay but danger now forbid it for my lord return by this time homeward from the palace we must obey the time necessity sweet Poppaea though I part from thou with such a sadness as will lose by all comparison and can be express but by itself to say that otho part from fair Poppaea be more tragical than soul from body honour from a man I can methinks flatter my fear to keep thou ever here and I can scorn all fear and danger too if thou command i stay no go my love and wary let|we meet that we may often meet but why shall still our high bliss want freedom

teach fire-breathing bull do guard the colchian fleece a wake dragon keep the golden fruit but thou Poppaea in my thought a prize of great value and more lustre far then that which draw the bold

the hope of thousand noble youth have thou be see Poppaea bed and beauty have be thou and with a lawful uncontrolled flame have meet thy wish in those delight which now we be enforce to steal must it be so for ever then nor can I blame bless Rufus if he strive to keep that wealth which if it lay beyond the indian Ganges scythian Tanais or horn Ammon scorch and thirsty sand will draw the roman monarch to forsake his world imperial seat there to enjoy and think those banish that remain at Rome if I be Caesar and condemn by fate to want Poppaea love I shall be poor no other dear prerogative can that high wreath bestow but only power to make thou i without a rival I may then with boldness take thou from Crispinus arm can thou doubt it where two love meet can marriage be unlawful of which love be the soul the very form that give it be no dead outward ty but nature strong and inward sympathy can make a marriage which the god alone have power to breed in we and therefore they have only power to tie so sweet a knot I be thy mate nor do thy father when he give that snowy hand unto another ought but rebel against the god decree thou be to good a advocate and I too partial for a judge be constant to i till fortune give a bold privilege and warrant to our love of which I have receive such fair presage as I can despair meanwhile by stealth I must behold those starry eye and think myself most happy in that though no man know my happiness can man count those delight a happiness which they conceal Come Lucius study to forget it now and let|we be true merry my Poppaea bid Lucius Geta welcome my colleague that be but still my friend but my lord what mean that speech of you that Lucius Geta once be your colleague and be not I tell thou great Agrippina have command Caesar to command Pallas to command we two To quit our charge and sudden resign the government of the praetorian camp 〈◊〉 Burrhus hand at which he storm but I am merry far and light than before we may live free now Caesar have take 〈◊〉 weighty burden from my weary neck Thank his goodness thank his sottishness it|be that have pleasure you ah friend it needs must grieve all noble heart that can love justice and pity suffer innocence to see the harmless year of young Britannicus expose to all the malice of his foe and stupid Caesar make the instrument to ruin his own son while his great power by other be abuse against himself and his posterity his servant all that to himself be true or faithful to his son be murder now or else displace by she our truth|be the cause that we have lose our place it|be no matter we lose no honour by our truth and since while we have power we faithful discharge our trust to Caesar let|we not long strive to guard he against his will but take his gift he give we ease and freedom to retire and taste the sweet of privacy and there enjoy our life free from the glorious noise and trouble of a court instead of wait on Caesar now on thou I will bestow that time my fair Poppaea and attend on thy delight thou will not cast i off as Caesar do she can promise you I know her heart better than you in that none can describe the sweet of country life but those bless man that do enjoy and taste they plain husband man though far below our pitch of fortune place enjoy a wealth above we to who the earth with true and bounteous justice free from war care return a easy food they breathe the fresh and uncorrupted air and by clear brook enjoy untroubled sleep their state be fearless and secure enrich with several blessing such as great king may in true justice envy and themselves will count too happy if they true know they it|be true Crispinus great monarch oft have in the midst of all their careful glory desire such life as those plain people lead let we enjoy that happiness than Lucius the country sport and recreation and friend as innocent as we with who we need not fear the strength of rich wine in draw out our secret but well fill at suppertime may hold a free discourse of Caesar weakness of the wealth and pride of his freedman how lordly Pallas rule how fierce and cruel Agrippina be what slave the roman senate be become and yet next morn awake with confidence all this my lord you may discourse at Rome if you can wise choose your company Well say Poppaea thou be a woman right thou love the city well I can blame she such beauty seek no corner but may well become the imperial city of the world Come Lucius Geta let|we go in and laugh at our proud enemy enjoy their malice and drown our care in rich falernian wine as ancient as Opimius consulship here come a man Crispinus I believe be sorry for this change Haile to you Narcissus How dare you venture a salute on we or make a visit to such guilty man in be wrong those that be wrong in court be make offender I must confess my lord it be a wrong to you and your colleague to be displace but you have spirit great enough to scorn that injury and pity he that do it I mean that suffer his proud foe to do it rather against himself than you the wrong must fall on Caesar and his hapless house blind by fate and near his fall he throw away the best supporter of his state the thought of that as I be true Narcissus afflict i more than my own loss can do for i I think myself well free from trouble be|it not for fear of poor Britannicus I do believe it noble lord but you be now discharge and may retire with safety my part be yet to play a part of danger and I will act it brave here I vow by all the god no fear shall make i shrink till I have once more right Claudius against the lust and treason of a wife nor do I boast of Messalina death it be the time necessity that make i then to show my power that power perchance be yet as much nor shall the lordly Pallas though swell with Agrippina lustful favour and back by her authority he think himself sole ruler in the imperial house find that Narcissus be so fall in spirit but that I dare attempt as much as then great Caesar safety be as much in danger as then it be his nuptial bed as stain and I will die or take the same revenge that then be take all their plot and treason will I reveal to Caesar and pursue it with such a dauntless constancy that if the god forget not to be just this day proud Agrippina and her minion fall the young Britannicus shall stand secure in his high birthright Messalina ghost shall then perchance although she hate i now forgive the hand that cause her overthrow you shall do a act that all good man shall thank you for will you go in and taste my wine not now I come but only to reveal my purpose to you who noble wish may befriend it and when occasion serve may true witness my just intent this hour I be expect by Caesar in his garden there I|will put my life upon the hazard every minute may breed a change and all delay have danger for Caesar upon those discovery that I already have make to he utter some word last night at supper in his wine of which I fear that Agrippina take too great a notice therefore speed must help we farewell my lord so rich a bondage be Poppaea love that I be base if I shall with for freedom nay more ingrate shall I desire to change so sweet a care for quietness itself shall I suppose that state which some dull soul call calm content be half so rich so free as be these pine this captivity be there in love no care no sigh no fear there be in love no happiness at all what bliss what wealth do ever the world bestow on man but care and fear attend it yet who so base as to be free from those will throw away the high bliss on earth let silly shepherd who poor narrow soul not much exceed the beast they tend and feed that know like they no far region than some few field no large bound of pleasure then satisfaction of bare nature needs be still secure since they have nought to lose and rest content because they never know what city be and gorgeous palace shall monarch who be teach to know the extent of nature wealth and what the world afford forgo their glorious fortune because they want that wretched thing which only ignorance and low contempt can give security shall I forgo my fair Poppaea love because some care some fear and sigh attend it when every smile of she can recompense a thousand such be too much poorness in i have I never see those starry eye of she more hapless far my ignorance have be I have like wretched man that be bear blind never know there be a sun to guild the world but to enjoy her love without all fear without all rival be a bliss beyond mortality the god will envy i she|be now another man that may be think the great bar to Otho happiness but I have frame in my jealous thought a great bar then that young Nero Caesar in who acquaintance I of late have find so near a room as fair presage tell we be like to wear the imperial wreath he power may take she for i from Crispinus arm but then perchance I lose she more than ever or shall he see she now to rival i I be undo he|be amorous and oft solicit i to let he see my mistress I for that friendship which I dare not lose dare not deny his importunity and therefore to prevent what may ensue for yet he never hear Poppaea name I have make love to the fair free woman young act of mean rank but such a face as whosoever have not see Poppaea will think this act nature masterpiece on she will I divert young Nero love and to that purpose I have get her picture but here he come enter Nero what Otho still retire where live the face that breed this melancholy there be no other cause can do|it I know thou be not busy with affair of state I prithee let i see she a friend counsel may ease thy passion it|be not fit a prince shall stoop so low as to the passion of private man the name of friend admit of no such distance sir no man who you be please to call a friend deserve that name unless he know himself to be your servant Come prithee leave thy fool and be plain where there be no familiarity society be lose why be thou fearful to let i see she whosoever she be Sr. I can give you a plain common reason if she be foul she be not worth your sight if fair you be too great a rival for i but yet know sir I be so free from those unworthy fear that I dare trust my life my love and all I have into your hand speak like a friend and thou may safe do|it then first behold her picture and by that find whether she be worth the sight or no o no he have not art enough to reach the glory of it be the substance here how dull will this now lovely table show see how his greedy eye devour the picture he|be catch he|be catch Cupid I thank thou now I never see true beauty till this hour but wherefore do thou wish there be no substance so sweet as this why will thou be deprive of such a happiness but I perceive it be thy fear come let it not be so I but desire to see whether the painter have err or no and do not think my Otho that I will wrong thy love so much or make my wife Octavia jealous sir however my life my love and fortune all be you exeunt your majesty may yet prevent it all and just throw upon the traitor head that ruin which so bold threaten you and your too much abuse family yet Caesar may be safe if he will use that power the god have put into his hand what course Narcissus can we run to make the people sensible of our estate what danger threaten we and how our justice be force to meet the treason of a wife let not too vain a care of popular breath or what the vulgar may surmise outweigh the safety of your person and your house but I be most assure that all the world except yourself have long observe their plot and if they see your waken justice now arise to censure Agrippina death they will not think the execution do too soon on she these humble knee o Caesar which for your safety I so oft have bow before the god now to your sacred self I bow entreat that you will be safe and not believe the god by miracle will work for you while you neglect yourself arise Narcissus it|be the unhappy fate of prince ever as Augustus Caesar be wont to say the people never believe that treason be complot against their person until those treason take effect and then too late perchance they pity and believe but be the wise Augustus therefore slow or timorous to cut offender off fear he the people whisper Caesar no he well know to use the sword he have he have not else live till time gentle hand dissolve in peace his long felicity and make the world by such continuance of power believe he be a god on earth but some offender be too great to suffer the common course of justice against such wise prince have forbear to draw the sword and rather seek some way of policy how to ensnare they Caesar those be way as much unfit for prince as unsafe as many monarch have in dangerous time be ruine quite by go way too low though they have seem subtle as proud subject have be undo by play prince part and as this high and open way befit the power and person of earth great monarch so it befit the time necessity you have already Caesar show your sword and if you strike not now you do not right yourself at all but only arm your foe with plot of mischief to prevent their own and hasten on your quick destruction you have already threaten and those speech by Agrippina and her minion Pallas be overhear who like see snake will now bestir themselves in a more desperate fury I have already cast my own poor life into the utmost hazard but alas that be a thing not now considerable the god above can tell how willing for Caesar safety I will sacrifice this life make i the chief instrument impose what part of this exploit you please upon Narcissus hand and if I fail to execute I|will not refuse to die o my Narcissus I have find thy faith in other service it be resolve their pride shall feel my justice thou shall see how soon I will secure myself and thou exeunt we be discover Pallas all our drift be sound by Narcissus and by he lay open to Caesar who dissemble yet the knowledge of it seek a sudden way to ruin both of we nor have we fear so soon as feel his fury have not wine betray his thought to we you know last night what speech Caesar in his drunkenness let fall before we and it|be late tell i that meeting young Britannicus he weep confess that he have wrong he and there vow a quick redress what counsel shall we take we have no time for counsel but must act as soon as think we go not now to work but to prevent a mischief and our cure must be as strong and quick of operation as our disease be dangerous and sudden that bird that see the snare and will be catch deserve his death and since that Caesar know his purpose be discover as Narcissus have before this inform he that we hear it he|will quick act what else he have defer no way be leave we but to meet the danger and for prevention first attempt to do that which we fear to suffer by what mean shall we procure his death for poison slow perchance may fail to lend a timely help unto our safety and too quick a venom may make the fact suspect shall the fact be never so much suspect your estate will be more safe than now it be but who will dare to utter it when Caesar dead and your own son the emperor for so my confidence assure i it will be therefore be speedy madam for your danger where fame where life and empire all be threaten give you no nice election so|it be do no matter how thou have confirm i Pallas the way|be resolve already there be late the fair mushroom send from Lybia that ere these eye behold a meat which he affect with greediness in one of those Caesar shall meet his death if that shall fail his chief physician Xenophon be i but be thing sting and ready to confirm the empire upon Nero it|be the best and happy time before Britannicus be grow to ripe year while yet he wear his childish robe and Nero have be show to all the people in triumphal weed but when the deed be do place wary your guard about the palace gate and keep Britannicus within while Nero back by Seneca and Burrhus by the camp and senate be salute emperor and all be settle sure how fit a time to work his own destruction Caesar choose to tempt with threaten Agrippina fury it must while Rufus live but can that act be lawful yes those that true love enter Fulvia madam my lord be come farewell dear otho farewell love guard thou till we meet again exit you be most welcome thank fair lady I do believe it I think so Lucius Haile
