victory and resolute Segar I mean to be perhaps some blissful star will favour we and comfort bring to our perplex state come let we in and fortify our camp so to withstand their strong invasion now be I guard with a host of man who haughty courage be invincible now be I hem with troop of soldier such as may force Bellona to retire and make she tremble at their puissance now sit I like the mighty god of war when arm with his coat of adamant mount his chariot draw with mighty bull he drive the argive over Xanthus stream now curse Humber do thy end draw nigh down go the glory of his victory and all his fame and all his high renown shall in a moment yield to Locrine sword thy brag banner cross with argent stream the ornament of thy pavilion shall all be captivate with this hand and thou

foul accurse grove that bear the token of our overthrow this Humber have entrench his damn camp march on my lord because I long to see the treacherous scythian squelter in their gore sweet fortune favour Locrine with a smile that I may venge my noble brother death and in the midst of stately Troynovant I|will build a temple to thy deity of perfect marble and of jacinthe stone that it shall pass the high pyramid which with their top surmount the firmament the armestrong offspring of the doubt knight stout Hercules Alcmena mighty son that tame the monster of the threefold world and rid the oppress from the tyrant yoke do never show such valiantness in fight as I will now for noble Albanact full four score year have Corineus live sometime in war sometime in quiet peace and yet I feel myself to be as strong as erst I be in summer of my age able to toss this great unwieldy club which have be paint with my foeman brain and with this club I|will break the strong array of Humber and his straggle soldier or lose my life among the thick press and die with honour in my late day yet ere I die they all shall understand what force lie in stout Corineus hand and if Thrasimachus detract the fight either for weakness or for cowardice let he not boast that Brutus be his eme or that brave Corineus be his sire then courage soldier first for your safety next for your peace last for your victory exeunt be thou that Humber prince of fugitive that by thy treason slay young Albanact I be his son that slay young Albanact and if thou take not heed proud phrygian I|will send thy soul unto the stygian lake there to complain of humber injury you triumph sir before the victory for Corineus be not so soon slay but curse scythian you shall rue the day that ere you come into Albania so perish that they envy Britain wealth so let they die with endless infamy and he that seek his sovereign overthrow will this my club may aggravate his woe where may I find some desert wilderness where I may breathe out curse as I will and scare the earth with my condemn voice where every echo repercussion may help i to bewail my overthrow and aid i in my sorrowful lament where may I find some hollow uncouth rock where I may damn condemn and ban my fill the heaven the hell the earth the air the fire and utter curse to the concave sky which may infect the airy region and light upon the Britain Locrine head you ugly spirit that in Cocytus mourn and gnash your tooth with dolorous lament yea fearful dog that in black Lathe howl and scare the ghost with your wide open throat you ugly
