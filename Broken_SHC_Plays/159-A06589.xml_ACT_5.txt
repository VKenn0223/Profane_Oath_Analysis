so honourable by birth so wise by education will have enter into a mischief to the god so odious to man so detestable and to her friend so malicious if Bagoa have not bewray it how then shall it have come to light but we see that gold and fair word be of force to corrupt the strong man and therefore able to work silly woman like wax I marvel what Cynthia will determine in this cause I fear as in all cause hear of it in justice and then judge of it in mercy for how can it be that she that be unwilling to punish her deadly foe with disgrace will revenge injury of her train with death that old witch Dipsas in a rage have understand she practise to be discover turn poor Bagoa to a aspen tree but let we make haste and bring tellus before Cynthia for she be come out after we let we go Dipsas thy year be not so many as thy vice yet more in number then common nature do afford or justice shall permit have thou almost these fifty year practise that detest wickedness of witchcraft be thou so simple as for to know the nature of simple of all creature to be most sinful thou have threaten to turn my course awry and alter by thy damnable art the government that I now possess by the eternal god but know thou Dipsas and let all the enchanter know that Cynthia be place for light on earth be also protect by the power of heaven breath out thou may word gather thou may herb find out thou may stone agreeable to thy art yet of no force to appall my heart in which courage be so root and constant persuasion of the mercy of the god so ground that all thy witchcraft I esteem as weak as the world do thy case wretched this noble gentleman Geron once thy husband but now thy mortal hate do thou procure to live in a desert almost desperate Endymion the flower of my court and the hope of succeed time have thou bewitch by art before thou will suffer he to flourish by nature madam thing past may be repent not recall there be nothing so wicked that I have not do nor any thing so wish for as death yet among all the thing that I commit there be nothing so much torment my rent and ransack thought as that in the prime of my husband youth I divorce he by my devilish art for which if to die may be amends I will not live till to morrow if to live and still be more miserable will better content he I will wish of all creature to be old and ugly Dipsas thou have make this difference between i and Endymion that be both young thou have cause i to wake in melancholy lose the joy of my youth and he to sleep not remember youth stay here come Tellus we shall now know all I will to Cynthia thou can make as good a excuse in truth as to i thou have do by wit truth shall be my answer and therefore I will not study for a excuse be it possible tellus that so few year shall harbour so many mischief thy swell pride have I bear because it be a thing that beauty make blameless which the more it exceed fairness in measure the more it stretch itself in disdain thy devise against Corsites I smile at for that wit the sharp they be the shrewd they be but this unacquainted and most unnatural practice with a vile enchantress against so noble a gentleman as Endymion I abhor as a thing most malicious and will revenge as a deed most monstrous and as for you Dipsas I will send you into the desert among wild beast and try whether you can cast lion tiger boar and bear into as dead asleep as you do Endymion or turn they to tree as you have do Bagoa but tell i Tellus what be the cause of this cruel part far unfitting thy sex in which nothing shall be but simpleness and much disagree from thy face in which nothing seem to be but softness divine Cynthia by who I receive my life and be content to end it I can neither excuse my fault without lie nor confess it without shame yet be it possible that in so heavenly thought as you there can fall such earthly motion as i I will then hope if not to be pardon without extreme punishment yet to be hear without great marvel Say on tellus I can imagine any thing that can colour such a cruelty Endymion that Endymion in the prime of his youth so ravish my heart with love that to obtain my desire I can not find mean nor to recite they reason what be she that favour not Endymion be young wise honourable and virtuous beside what mettle be she make of be she mortal that be not affect with the spice nay infect with the poison of that not to be express yet always to be feel love which break the brain and never bruise the brow consume the heart and never touch the skin and make a deep scar to be see before any wound at all be feel my heart too tender to withstand such a divine fury yield to love madam I not without blush confess yield to love a strange effect of love to work such a extreme hate How say you Endymion all this be for love I say madam then the god send i a woman hate that be as bad for then by contrary you shall never sleep but on tellus let we hear the end feel a continual burn in all my bowel and a burst almost in every vain I can not smother the inward fire but it must needs be perceive by the outward smoke and by the fly abroad of diverse spark diverse judge of my scald flame Endymion as full of art as wit mark my eye in which he may see almost his own my sigh by which he may ever hear his name sound aim at my heart in which he be assure his person be imprint and by question wring out that which be ready to burst out when he see the depth of my affection he swear that my in respect of he be as fume to Aetna valley to Alps ant to eagle and nothing can be compare to my beauty but his love and eternity thus draw a smooth shoe upon a crooked foot he make i believe that which all of our sex willing acknowledge I be beautiful and to wonder which indeed be a thing miraculous that any of his sex shall be faithful Endymion how will you clear yourself madam by my own accuser Well tellus proceed but brief least take delight in utter thy love thou offend we with the length of it I will madam quick make a end of my love and my tale find continual increase of my torment thought and that the enjoy of my love make deep wound then the enter into it I can find no mean to ease my grief but to follow Endymion and continual to have he in the object of my eye who have i slave and subject to his love but in the moment that I fear his falsehood and fry myself most in my affection I find ah grief even than I lose myself I find he in most melancholy and desperate term curse his star his state the earth the heaven the world and all for the love of of who Tellus speak bold madam I dare not utter for fear to offend speak I say who dare take offence if thou be command by Cynthia for the love of Cynthia for my love Tellus that be strange Endymion be it true in all thing madam Tellus do not speak false what will this breed to in the end well Endymion we shall hear all I see my hope turn to mishap and a settle dissemble towards i and a unmoveable desire to Cynthia forget both myself and my sex fall unto this unnatural hate for know your virtue Cynthia to be immortal I can not have a imagination to withdraw he And find my own affection unquenchable I can not carry the mind that any else shall possess what I have pursue for though in majesty beauty virtue and dignity I always humble and yield myself to Cynthia yet in affection I esteem myself equal with the goddess and all other creature accord to their state with myself for star to their bigness have their light and the sun have no more and little pytcher when they can hold no more be as full as great vessel that run over thus madam in all truth have I utter the unhappiness of my love and the cause of my hate yield whole to that divine judgement which never err for want of wisdom or envy for too much partiality How say you my lord to this matter but what say you Endymion have Tellus tell troth madam in all thing but in that she say I love she and swear to honour she be there such a time whenas for my love thou do vow thyself to death and in respect of it loathe thy life speak Endymion I will not revenge it with hate the time be madam and be and ever shall be that I honour your highness above all the world but to stretch it so far as to call it love I never dare there have none please my eye but Cynthia none delight my ear but Cynthia none possess my heart but Cynthia I have forsake all other fortune to follow Cynthia and here I stand ready to die if it please Cynthia such a difference have the god set between our state that all must be duty loyalty and reverence nothing without it vouchsafe your highness be term love my unspotted thought my languish body my discontent life let they obtain by princely favour that which to challenge they must not presume only wish of impossibility with imagination of which I will spend my spirit and to myself that no creature may hear soft call it love and if any urge to utter what I whisper then will I name it honour from this sweet contemplation if I be not drive I shall live of all man the most content take more pleasure in my age thought then ever I do in my youthful action Endymion this honourable respect of thou shall|be christen love in thou and my reward for it favour persevere Endymion in love i and I account more strength in a true heart then in a wall city I have labour to win all and study to keep such as I have win but those that neither my favour can move to continue constant nor my offer benefit get to be faithful the god shall either reduce to truth or revenge their treachery with justice Endymion continue as thou have begin and thou shall find that Cynthia shine not on thou in vain your highness have bless i and your word have again restore my youth methinks I feel my joint strong and these mouldy hair to moult and all by your virtue Cynthia into who hand the balance that weigh time and fortune be commit what young again than it be pity to punish Tellus ah Endymion now I know thou and ask pardon of thou suffer i
