the sun do beat upon the plain field wherefore let we sit down Galathea under this fair oak by who broad leaf be defend from the warm beam we may enjoy the fresh air which soft breathe from Humber flood father you have devise well and while our flock do roam up and down this pleasant green you shall recount to i if it please you for what cause this tree be dedicate unto Neptune and why you have thus disguise i I do agree thereto and when thy state and my care be consider thou shall know this question be not ask in vain I willing attend in time past where thou see a heap of small pebble stand a stately temple of white marble which be dedicate to the god of the sea and in right be so near the sea hither come all such as either venture by long travel to see country or by great traffic to use merchandise offer sacrifice by fire to get safety by water yield thank for peril past and make prayer for good success to come but fortune constant in nothing but inconstancy do change her copy as the people their custom for the land be oppress by Dane who instead of sacrifice commit sacrilege in steed of religion rebellion and make a prey of that in which they shall have make their prayer tear down the temple even with the earth be almost equal with the sky enrage so the god who bind the wind in the hollow of the earth that he cause the sea to break their bound sith man have break their vow and to swell as far above their reach as man have swerve beyond their reason then may you see ship sail where sheep feed anchor cast where plough go fisherman throw their net where husbandman sow their corn and fish throw their scale where fowl do breed their quill then may you gather froth where now be dew rot weed for sweet rose and take view of monstrous mermaid instead of pass fair maid to hear these sweet marvel I will my eye be turn also into ear but at the last our countryman repent and not too late because at last Neptune either weary of his wrath or wary to do they wrong upon condition consent to ease their misery what condition will not miserable man accept the condition be this that at every five year day the fair and chaste virgin in all the country shall be bring unto this tree and here be bind who neither parentage shall excuse for honour nor virtue for integrity be leave for a peace offer unto Neptune dear be the peace that be buy with guiltless blood I be not able to say that but he send a monster call the Agar against who come the water roar the fowl fly away and the cattle in the field for terror shun the bank and she bind to endure that horror and she bind to endure that horror do this monster devour she whether she be devour of he or convey to Neptune or drown between both it be not permit to know and incur danger to conjecture now Galathea here end my tale and begin thy tragedy Alas father and why so I will thou have be less fair or more fortunate then shall thou not repine that I have disguise thou in this attire for thy beauty will make thou to be think worthy of this God to avoid therefore destiny for wisdom rule the star I think it better to use a unlawful mean your honour preserve then intolerable grief both life and honour hazard and to prevent if it be possible thy constellation by my craft now have thou hear the custom of this country the cause why this tree be dedicate unto Neptune and the vex care of thy fearful father father I have be attentive to hear and by your patience be ready to answer destiny may be defer not prevent and therefore it be better to offer myself in triumph than to be draw to it with dishonour have nature as you say make i so fair above all and shall not virtue make i as famous as other do you not know or do overcarefulness make you forget that a honourable death be to be prefer before a infamous life I be but a child and have not live long and yet not so childish as I desire to live ever virtue I mean to carry to my grave not grey hair I will I be as sure that destiny will light on i as I be resolve it can not fear i nature have give i beauty virtue courage nature must yield i death virtue honour suffer i therefore to die for which I be bear or let i curse that I be bear sith I may not die for it Alas Galathea to consider the cause of change thou be too young and that I shall find they out for thou too too fortunate the destiny to i can be so hard as the disguise hateful to gain love the god have take shape of beast and to save life be thou coy to take the attire of man they be beastly god that lust can make they seem as beast in health it be easy to counsel the sick but
