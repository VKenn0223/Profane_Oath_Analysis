remove from the king grace to slander he the king will lend no ear to any just complaint that|be make of he what can our scandal do then challenge he of treason then and that may haply call his loyalty into suspect and question which in the king at least will breed a coldness if not a deadness of affection of treason say he crave the combat then for that|be the least he can which of we two shall combat he I know his blow too well not I I shall be loath how do you relish this his virtue and his bounty win he grace on that we|will build to ruin all his favour and work he to disgrace pray teach i how first praise he to the king give all his virtue double their due add unto every thing ay and hyperbolize in all his deed let his know virtue be the common theme of our discourse to stale he rate his worth to equalise if not to exceed the king this can but beget distaste at least but further thus then fall off from his praise and question his best deed as it may be his noble bounty be but popular grace and his humility but inward pride his vulgar suffrage and applause abroad a way to climb and seat himself aloft you understand i full come to horse and as we ride our further plot

marshal strive to exceed and do but when he see your highness move to see the prince disgrace he lose the prize but how that all the people may see it give not forfeit which do add rather than derogate brief my lord his courtesy be all ambition and well it may be be he not our vassal why shall the marshal then contend with we to exceed in any virtue we observe he his popularity how affable he|be to the people his hospitality which add unto his love his forwardness to entertain ambassador and feast they which though he do|it upon his proper charge and for our honour yet it may be think a smoothness and a cunning to grow great it must be so a project we intend to prove he faithless or a perfect friend it take these jealous thought we must pursue and to his late doubt still add

and game I|will help to further both till I be force to alight my horse with you keep equal speed I do my lord and then alight true what I have do my lord I do to you we have visit all our familiar be it not now time that we revisit our captain with all my heart good corporal but it have not be amiss if we have go to Burchen-lane first to have suit we and yet it be a credit for a man of the sword to go threadbare because by his apparel he may be take to be a old soldier Cocke thy father be a fresh water soldier thou be not thou have be powder witness thy flax and touchbox but who come yonder my match I be glad I have meet thou I know cock at one time or other thou will meet with thy match what shall we go to my captain lodging Fortun' de la guere I that have flourish no colour like i nay no trumpet thou in his high key have nothing now but rag to flourish I that have face the enemy have not so much as any face leave i be my suit but as well point as I have see some and stand I but in the midst of my follower I may say I have nothing about i but tag and rag I be descend noble for I be descend so low that all the clothes of my back be scarce worth a noble I be bear to thousand and yet a thousand to one they will now scarce acknowledge i where I be bear health to our worthy captain thank my most worthy soldier and yet if I shall examine your worth what at the most can all you make I will not have your worship to examine our outside and for your inside I|will pass my word can all your worship credit afford you a new suit credit i no my revenue be a thousand a year part of which I lavish among gallant riot in tavern havoc in ordinary and when my estate begin to ebb as my last refuge I lay all my hope upon the last war but fail there as the world imagine I be return as you see the king have promise supply and relief to all that have spend their estate in his expedition but many like myself have be bear to be poor that scorn to be beggar as many have be bear to be rich that can never leave it the truth be I be myself as my proceed will express i further will you cashier we captain or shall we follow your future fortune you shall not leave i my purpose be to try the humour of all my friend my ally my ancient associate and see how they will respect i in my suppose poverty though I lose their acquaintance I will lose none of my retinue How say you gentleman will you copart with i in this my dejectedness as I be corporal so will I prove true squire to thy body and as I be true cock so will I crow at thy service wait on thou with a comb for thy head with fire to thy piece with water to thy hand and be cock sure in any employment whatsoever and as I be true match I shall scorn that any of they shall overmatch i in duty attend i then if I rise you shall ascend if fall I will lie flat with you first then I will make some trial of my friend at the court and in good time here|be the king and do not i so too pray what|be your business only that you will know i the king favour have make you a baron and the king war have make i a bare one there|be less difference in the accent of the word than in the cost of our weed this be the same face you be once acquaint with though not the same habit I can know your face though your disease body be wrap in sheepskin this fellow offend i go churl pass free thou know my forfeit land though forget i nay you will be go too you be as afraid of a tear suit as a young brother of a sergeant a rich corn-master of a plentiful year or a troublesome attorney to hear of suit put to compromise yet I can purchase that which all the wealth you have will never win you here noble captain you see how our friend grace we what hope we have to prefer you I see sufficient captain I will discharge myself I mean to seek elsewhere for preferment all leave i if you please but he that stay if ever I mount I|will with my fortune raise captain I desire your pass I mean to march along with my corporal will thou go to I leave you who I for a little diversity for a wet storm no sir though your outside fall away I|will cleave as close to you as your lining gramercy yet away without reply foutre for thy base service away 'sfoot how be I fall out of my humour and yet this strangeness of my near friend and alliance deserve a little contemplate be|it possible that even lord that have the best educate who ear be frequent to the most fluent discourse that live in the very brain of the land the court that these shall be gull with shadow and not be able to distinguish a man when they see he thou know i yet these do not why may not a poor man have as good eye as another their ear indeed may be large than i but I can see as far without spectacle as the best lord in the land these superficial lord that think every thing to be as it appear they never question a man wit his discretion his language his inward virtue but as he seem he pass the next I try be my betroth if she acknowledge this hand that have receive she this heart this face and know the person from the garment I shall say woman there be more virtue in thou than man there|be no question of that for they say they will hold out better but sir if we be no better habit I make a question how we shall get in at the courtgate for I|will assure you your fashion be not in request at the court my virtue be not to be imitate I|will hold my purpose though I be keep back and venture lash in the porter lodge Come follow i I will go see my mistress though gird with all the lady of the court
