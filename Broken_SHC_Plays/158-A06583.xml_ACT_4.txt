liar no I warrant you for I will always say the athenian be mischievous I care not it be sport enough for i to see these old huddle hit home nor I Come let we go and hereafter when I mean to raise upon anybody open it shall be give out I will fly Campaspe it be hard to judge whether thy choice be more unwise or thy chance unfortunate do thou prefer but stay utter not that in word which make thy ear to glow with thought tush better thy tongue wag than thy heart break have a painter creep further into thy mind then a prince Apelles then Alexander fond wench the baseness of thy mind bewray the meanness of thy birth but alas affection be a fire which kindle aswell in the bramble as in the oak and catch hold where it first light not where it may best burn lark that mount aloft in the air build their nest below in the earth and woman that cast their eye upon king may place their heart upon vassal a needle will become thy finger better than a lute and a distaff be fit for thy hand then a sceptre aunt live safe till they have get wing and juniper be not blow up till it have get a high top the mean estate be without care as long as it continue without pride but here come Apelles in who I will there be the like affection gentlewoman the misfortune I have with your picture will put you to some pain to sit again to be paint it be small pain for i to sit still but infinite for you to draw still no madam to paint Venus be a pleasure but to shadow the sweet face of Campaspe it be a heaven if your tongue be make of the same flesh that your heart be your word will be as your thought be but such a common thing it be among you to commend that oftentimes for fashion sake you call they beautiful who you know black what may man do to be believe whet their tongue on their heart so they do and speak as they think I will they do I will they do not why will you have they dissemble not in love but their love but will you give i leave to ask you a question without offence so that you will answer i another without excuse who do you love best in the world he that make i last in the world that be a God I have think it have be a man but who do you honour most Apelles the thing that be like you Campaspe my picture I dare not venture upon your person but come let we go in for Alexander will think it long till we return we hear nothing of our embassage a colour belike to blear our eye or tickle our ear or inflame our heart but what do Alexander in the mean season but use for tantara sol fa La. for his hard couch down bed for his handful of water his stand cup of wine Clytus I mislike this new delicacy and please peace for what else do we see now then a kind of softness in every man mind bee to make their hive in soldier helmet our steed furnish with foot clothes of gold instead of saddle of steel more time to be require to scour the rust of our weapon then there be wont to be in subdue the country of our enemy since Alexander fall from his hard armour to his soft robe behold the face of his court youth that be wont to carry devise of victory in their shield engrave now posy of love in their ring they that be accustom on trot horse to charge the enemy with a lance now in easy coach ride up and down to court lady in steed of sword and target to hazard their life use pen and paper to paint their love yea such a fear and faintness be grow in court that they wish rather to hear the blow of a horn to hunt than the sound of a trumpet to fight o Philip be thou alive to see this alteration thy man turn to woman thy soldier to lover glove wear in velvet cap in steed of plume in grave helmet thou will either die among they for sorrow or confound they for anger cease Permenio lest in speak what become thou not thou feel what like thou not truth be never without a scratch face who tongue although it can be cut out yet must it be tie up it grieve i not a little for Hephestion who thirst for honour not ease but such be his fortune and nearness in friendship to Alexander that he must lay a pillow under his head when he will put a target in his hand but let we draw in to see how well it become they to tread the measure in a dance that be wont to set the order for a march I have now Campaspe almost make a end you tell i Apelles you will never end never end my love for it shall be eternal that be neither to have beginning nor end you be dispose to mistake I hope you do not mistrust what will you say if Alexander perceive your love I will say it be no treason to love but how if he will not suffer thou to see my person then will I gaze continual on thy picture that will not feed thy heart yet shall it fill my eye beside the sweet thought the sure hope thy protest faith will cause i to embrace thy shadow continual in my arm of the which by strong imagination I will make a substance well I must be go but this assure yourself that I have rather be in thy shop grind colour then in Alexander court follow high fortune foolish wench what have thou do that alas which can be undo and therefore I fear i undo but content be such a life I care not for abundance o Apelles thy love come from the heart but Alexander from the mouth the love of king be like the blow of wind which whistle sometime gentle among the leaf and straight way turn the tree up by the root or fire which warm afar off and burn near hand or the sea which make man hoist their sail in a flatter calm and to cut their mast in a rough storm they place affection by time by policy by appointment if they frown who dare call they unconstant if bewray secret who will term they untrue if fall to other love who tremble not if he call they unfaithful in king there can be no love but to queen for as near must they meet in majesty as they do in affection it be requisite to stand aloof from king love love and lighten now Apelles gather thy wit together Campaspe be no less wise than fair thyself must be no less cunning then faithful it be no small matter to be rival with Alexander Apelles you must come away quick with the picture the king think that now you have paint it you play with it if I will play with picture I have enough at home none perhaps you like so well it may be I have paint none so well I have know many fair face and I many better boy
