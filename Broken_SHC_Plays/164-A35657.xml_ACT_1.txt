my lord you have good intelligence what news from the army any certainty of their design or strength we know not their design but for their strength the disproportion be so great we can but expect a fatal consequence how great my lord the Turk be fourscore thousand foot and fifty thousand horse and we in the whole exceed not forty thousand methinks the prince shall know that judgement|be more essential to a general than courage if he prove victorious it|be but a happy rashness but if he lose the battle it|be a error beyond excuse or remedy consider that half the lesser Asia will follow the victor fortune it|be his single virtue and terror of his name that wall we in from danger be he lose the naked empire will be a prey expose to all invader but be|it not necessary the king shall know his danger to tell he of so great a danger be but to draw a great on ourselves for though his eye be open as the morning towards lust and pleasure yet so fast a lethargy have seize his power towards public care and danger he sleep like death he|be a man of that strange composition make up of all the worst extremity of youth and age and though he feel the heat of youth and cold of age yet neither temper nor correct the other as if there be a ague in his nature that still incline to one extreme but the caliph or Haly or some that know his soft hour may best acquaint he with it Alas they show he nothing but in the glass of flattery if any thing may bear a show of glory fame or greatness it|be multiply to a immense quantity and stretch even to divinity but if it tend to danger or dishonour they turn about the perspective and show it so little at such distance so like nothing that he can scarce discern it it|be the fate of prince that no knowledge come pure to they but pass through the eye and ear of other man it take a tincture from every channel and still bear a relish of flattery or private end but danger and necessity dare speak the truth but common they speak not till it be too late and for Haly he that shall tell he of the prince danger but tell he that himself be safe clear up clear up sweet Erythaea that cloud that hang upon thy brow presage a great storm than all the turkish power can throw upon we methinks I see my fortune settle her look by thou and in thy smile sit victory and in thy frown our ruin why shall not hope as much erect our thought as fear deject they why shall we anticipate our sorrow it|be like those that die for fear of death what be|it you doubt his courage or his fortune envy itself can never doubt his courage then let not love do worse by doubt that which be but valour slave a wise well-tempered valour for such be he those giant death and danger be but his minister and serve a master more to be fear than they and the blind goddess be lead among the captive in his triumph I have rather she have eye for if she see he sure she will love he better but admit she be at once a goddess and his slave yet fortune valour all be overbear by number as the long resist bank by the impetuous torrent that|be but rumour never do the Turk invade our territory but fame and terror double still their file but when our troop encounter than we find scarce a sufficient matter for our fury but hark a post Solyman conduct he in it|be sure from the prince give it our secretary I hope the prince be well the letter will inform you sir the lord

be poor sure the villain hold a correspondence with the enemy and thus they will betray we first give we up to want then to contempt and then to ruin but tell those son of earth I|will have their money or their head it|be my command when such occasion be no plea must serve it|be cruelty to spare the prince transport with his youthful heat I fear have go too far it|be some disaster or else he will not send so thick well bring he in I be prepare to hear the worst of evil what be the prince besiege in his trench and must have speedy aid or die by famine or have he rash try the chance of war and lose his army and his liberty tell i what province they demand for ransom or if the worst of all mishap have fall speak for he can not die unlike himself speak free and yet methinks I read something of better fortune in thy look but dare not hope it sir the prince live And have not lose his honour as safe in honour as in life nor liberty free as the air he breathe return with speed tell

when he have slay the ambitious giant that assail the sky and as my power resemble that of jove so shall thy glory like high Phoebus shine as bright and as immortal great sir all acquisition of glory as of empire here I lay before your royal foot happy to be the instrument to advance either sir I challenge nothing but be a humble suitor for these prisoner the late commander of the turkish power who valour have deserve a better fortune then what have thy deserve the be thy brave Mirzah worthy of all thy royal ancestor and all those many kingdom which their virtue or get or keep though thou have not be bear to|it but daughter still your look be sad no long I|will defer your joy go take he into thy chaste embrace and whisper to he that welcome which those blush promise my Erythaea why entertain thou with so sad a brow my long desire return thou be wont with kiss and sweet smile to welcome home my victory though buy with sweat and blood and long expect pardon sir it|be with our soul as with our eye that after a long darkness be dazzle at the approach of sudden light when in|the midst of fear we be surprise with unexpected happiness the first degree of joy be mere astonishment and it|be so late in a dreadful dream I see my lord so near destruction deprive of his eye a wretched captive then shriek myself awake then sleep again and dream the same my ill presage fancy suggest still it|be true then I forgive thy sadness since love cause it for love be full of fear and fear the shadow of danger like the shadow of our body be great then when that which be the cause be far off but still there|be something that check my joy nor can I yet distinguish which be the apparition this or that a apparition at night I shall resolve that doubt and make thy dream more please the time have be my lord when I be no such stranger to your thought you be not wont to wear upon your brow a frown or smile but still have think i worthy at least to know the cause it|be true thy breast have ever be the cabinet where I have lock my secret and do you ever find that any art can pick the lock or power can force it open no I have ever find thou trusty and secret but be|it observe in|the court that I be sad observe it|be all man wonder and discourse that in a joy so great so universal you shall not bear a part discourse of too nothing but treason more common more bold speak so singular a sadness must have a cause as strange as the effect and grief conceal like hide fire consume which flame out will call in help to quench it but since thou can not mend it to let thou know it will but make thou worse silence and time shall cure it but in disease when the cause be know it|be more than half the cure you have my lord my heart to counsel and my hand to act and my advice and action both have meet success in thing unlikely but this be such a secret I dare hardly trust it to my own soul and though it be a crime in friendship to betray a trust counsel yet to conceal this be a great crime and of a high nature now I know it and your endeavour to conceal it speak it more plain it|be some plot upon the prince o thou have touch my sore and have search it now heal it if thou can the prince do hate i or love i not or love another better which be all one This be know in court have render i despise and scorn of all for I that in his absence blaze like a star of the first magnitude now in his bright sunshine be not see no application now no troop of suitor no power no not so much as to do mischief my lord I be ashamed of you so ill a master in a art so long profess and practise by you to be angry and angry with a prince and yet to show it in a sad look or womanish complaint how can you hope to compass your design and not dissemble they go flatter and adore he stand first among the crowd of his admirer o I have often spread those net but he have ever be too wise to think they real however dissemble still thank he for all his injury take they for favour if at last you can gain he some pretty nimble poison may do the feat or if he will abroad find he some brave and honourable danger have I not find he out as many danger as Juno do for Hercules yet he return like Hercules double in strength and honour if danger can do it then try pleasure which when no other enemy survive still conquer all the conqueror endeavour to soften his ambition into lust contrive fit opportunity and lay bait for temptation I|will leave nothing unattempted but sure this will not take for all his passion affection and faculty be slave only to his ambition then let he fall by his own greatness and puff he up with glory till it swell and break he first betray he to himself then to his ruin from his virtue suck a poison as spider do from flower praise he to his father you know his nature let the prince glory seem to eclipse and cast a cloud on he and let fall something that may raise his jealousy but lest he shall suspect it draw it from he as fisher do the bait to make he follow it but the old king be so suspicious but withal most fearful he that view a fort to take it plant his artillery against the weak part work on his fear till fear have make he cruel and cruelty shall make he fear again methinks my lord you that so oft have sound and fathom all his thought that know the deep and shallows of his heart shall need no instrument to advance your end his passion and his fear lie leiger for you in his breast and there negotiate their affair Solyman be it your care to entertain the captain and the prisoner and use they kind sir I be not for entertainment now I be melancholy what grieve for our good fortune no sir but now the war be do we want pretence to put off creditor I be haunt sir not with ghost no sir material and substantial devil I know the cause what be|it thou owe they not much sir but so much as spoil i for a good fellow it|be but 2000 dollar a small sum to you sir well it shall be pay then if the devil come for drink let i alone with he well drink I love thou but too well already but I shall love thou better hereafter I have often drink myself into debt but never out of debt till now
