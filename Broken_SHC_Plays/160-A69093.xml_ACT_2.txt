argument though new handle and I be fearful I shall shame myself the subject be so thread bare then thus it be the question of estate or the state of the question be in brief whether in a aristocracy or in a democratical estate tobacco may be bring to lawful use but have you hear the excellent speech there touch this part first to the point then upstart a weaver blow up by|inspiration that have bear office in the congregation a little fellow and yet great in spirit I never shall forget he for he be a most hot livered enemy to tobacco his face be like the ten of diamond point each where with

sweet breath I will not be tedious to your highness you be not sir proceed tobacco that excellent plant the use whereof as of five element the world can want be that little shop of nature wherein her whole workmanship be abridge where you may see earth-kindled into fire the fire breath out a exhalation which enter in at the mouth walk through the region of a man brain drive out all ill vapour but itself down all bad humour by the mouth which in time may breed a scab over the whole body if already they have not a plant of singular use for on the one side nature be a enemy to vacuity and emptiness and on the other there be so many empty brain in the world as there be how shall nature course be continue how shall these empty brain be fill but with air nature immediate instrument to that purpose if with air what so proper as your fume what fume so healthful as your perfume what perfume so sovereign as tobacco beside the excellent edge it give a man wit as they can best judge that have be present at a feast of tobacco where common all good wit be consort what variety of discourse it beget what spark of wit it yield it be a world to hear as likewise to the courage of a man for
