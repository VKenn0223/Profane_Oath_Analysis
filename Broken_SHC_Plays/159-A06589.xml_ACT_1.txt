i find Eumenides in all thing both variety to content and satiety to glut save only in my affection which be so stay and withal so stately that I can neither satisfy my heart with love nor my eye with wonder my thought Eumenides be stitch to the star which be as high as I can see thou may imagine how much high they be then I can reach if you be enamour of any thing above the moon your thought be ridiculous for that thing immortal be not subject to affection if allure or enchant with these transitory thing under the moon you show yourself senseless to attribute such lofty title to such love trifle my love be place neither under the moon nor above I hope you be not sot upon the man in the moon no but settle either to die or possess the moon herself be Endymion mad or do I mistake do you love the moon Endymion Eumenides the moon there be never any so peevish to imagine the moon either capable of affection or shape of a mistress for as impossible it be to make love fit to her humour which no man know as a coat to her form which continue not in one bigness while she be measure cease of Endymion to feed so much upon fancy that melancholy blood must be purge which draw you to a dotage no less miserable than monstrous my thought have no vein and yet unless they be let blood I shall perish but they have vanity which be reform you may be restore o fair Cynthia why do other term thou unconstant who I have ever find unmoveable injurious time corrupt manner unkind man who find a constancy not to be match in my sweet mistress have christen she with the name of waver wax and wane be she inconstant that keep a settle course which since her first creation alter not one minute in her move there be nothing think more admirable or commendable in the sea than the ebb and flow and shall the moon from who the sea take this virtue be account fickle for increase and decrease flower in their bud be nothing worth till they be blow nor blossom account till they be ripe fruit and shall we then say they be changeable for that they grow from seed to leaf from leaf to bud from bud to their perfection then why be not twig that become tree child that become man and morning that grow to evening term waver for that they continue not at one stay I but Cynthia be in her fullness decay as not delight in her great beauty or wither when she shall be most honour when malice can object any thing folly will make that a vice which be the great virtue what thing my mistress except be in the pride of her beauty and latter minute of her age that wax young again tell i Eumenides what be he that have a mistress of ripe year and infinite virtue great honour and unspeakable beauty but will wish that she may grow tender again get youth by year and never decay beauty by time who fair face neither the summer blaze can scorch nor winter blast chap nor the number of year breed alter of colour such be my sweet Cynthia who time can touch because she be divine nor will offend because she be delicate o Cynthia if thou shall always continue at thy fullness both god and man will conspire to ravish thou but thou to abate the pride of our affection do detract from thy perfection think it sufficient if once in a month we enjoy a glimpse of thy majesty and then to increase our grief thou do decrease thy gleam come out of thy royal robe wherewith thou dazzle our eye down into thy swath clout beguile our eye and then stay there Endymion thou that commit idolatry will straight blaspheme if thou be suffer sleep will do thou more good than speech the moon hear thou not or if she do regard thou not vain Eumenides who thought never grow high than the crown of thy head why trouble thou i have neither head to conceive the cause of my love or a heart to receive the impression follow thou thy own fortune which creep on the earth and suffer i to fly to i who fall though it be desperate yet shall it come by dare farewell without doubt Endymion be bewitch otherwise in a man of such rare virtue there can not harbour a mind of such extreme madness I will follow he lest in this fancy of the moon he deprive himself of the sight of the sun treacherous and most perjure Endymion be Cynthia the sweetness of thy life and the bitterness of my death what revenge may be devise so full of shame as my thought be replenish with malice tell i Floscula if falseness in love can possible be punish with extremity of hate as long as sword fire or poison may be hire no traitor to my love shall live unrevenged Were thy oath without number thy kiss without measure thy sigh without end forge to deceive a poor credulous virgin who simplicity have be worth thy favour and better fortune if the god sit unequal beholder of injury or laugher at lover deceit then let mischief be as well forgive in woman as perjury wink at in man madam if you will compare the state of Cynthia with your own and the height of Endymion his thought with the meanness of your fortune you will rather yield than contend be between you and she no comparison and rather wonder than rage at the greatness of his mind be affect with a thing more than mortal no comparison floscula and why so be not my beauty divine who body be deck with fair flower and vein be vine yield sweet liquor to the dull spirit who ear be corn to bring strength and who hair be grass to bring abundance do not frankincense and mirth breath out of my nostril and all the sacrifice of the god breed in my bowel infinite be my creature without which neither thou nor Endymion nor any can love or live but know you not fair lady that Cynthia govern all thing your grape will be but dry husk your corn but chaff and all your virtue vain be it not Cynthia that preserve the one in the bud and nourish the other in the blade and by her influence both comfort all thing and by her authority command all creature suffer then Endymion to follow his affection though to obtain she be impossible and let he flatter himself in his own imagination because they be immortal loath I be Endymion thou shall die because I love thou well and that thou shall live it grieve i because thou love Cynthia too well in these extremity what shall I do Floscula no more word I be resolve he shall neither live nor die a strange practice if it be possible yes I will entangle he in such a sweet net that he shall neither find the mean to come out nor desire it all allurement of pleasure will I cast before his eye insomuch that he shall slake that love which he now vow to Cynthia and burn in i of which he seem careless in this languish between my amorous devise and his own loose desire there shall such dissolute thought take root in his head and over his heart grow so thick a skin that neither hope of preferment nor fear of punishment nor counsel of the wise nor company of the worthy shall alter his humour nor make he once to think of his honour a revenge incredible and if it may be unnatural he shall know the malice of a woman to have neither mean nor end and of a woman delude in love to have neither rule nor reason I can do it I must I will all his virtue will I shadow with vice his person ah sweet person shall he deck with such rich robe as he shall forget it be his own person his sharp wit ah wit too sharp that have cut off all my joy shall he use in flatter of my face and devise sonnet in my favour the prime of his youth and pride of his time shall be spend in melancholy passion careless behaviour untamed thought and unbridle affection when this be do what then shall it continue till his death or shall he dote for ever in this delight ah Floscula thou rend my heart in sunder in put i in remembrance of the end why if this be not the end all the rest be to no end yet suffer i to imitate Juno who will turn Jupiter lover to beast on the earth though she know afterward they shall be star in heaven affection that be breed by enchantment be like a flower that be wrought in silk in colour and form most like but nothing at all in substance or savour it shall suffice i if the world talk that I be favour of Endymion well use your own will but you shall find that love get with witchcraft be as unpleasant as fish take with medicine unwholesome they that be so poor that they have neither net nor hook will rather poison dough then pine with hunger and she that be so oppress with love that she be neither able with beauty nor wit to obtain her friend will rather use unlawful mean then try untolerable pain I will do it then about it poor Endymion what trap be lay for thou because thou honour one that all the world wonder at and what plot be cast to make thou unfortunate that study of all man to be the faithful now our master be in love up to the ear what have we to do but to be in knavery

overcome the terrible trout which although he be under the water yet tie a string to the top of my spear and a engine of iron to the end of my line I overthrow he and then herein I put he o wonderful war Dares do thou ever hear such a dolt all the better we shall have good sport hereafter if we can get leisure leisure I will rather lose my master service then his company look how he strut but what

river and there fortify for fish for there rest no minute free from fight behold Floscula we have meet with the woman by chance that we seek for by travel I will break my mind to she without ceremony or circumstance lest we lose that time in advice that shall be spend in execution use your discretion I will in this case neither give counsel nor consent for there can be a thing more monstrous than to force affection by sorcery neither do I imagine any thing more impossible tush Floscula in obtain of love what impossibility will I not try and for the win of Endymion what impiety will I not practise Dipsas who as many honour for age as wonder at for cunning listen in few word to my tale and answer in one word to the purpose for that neither my burn desire can afford long speech nor the short time I have to stay many delay be it possible by herb stone spell incantation enchantment exorcism fire metal planet or any practice to plant affection where it be not and to supplant it where it be fair lady you may imagine that these hoary hair be not void of experience nor the great name that go of my cunning to be without cause I can darken the sun by my skill and remove the moon out of her course I can restore youth to the age and make hill without bottom there be nothing that I can not do but that only which you will have i do and therein I differ from the god that I be not able to rule heart for be it in my power to place affection by appointment I will make such evil appetite such inordinate lust such curse desire as all the world shall be fill both with superstitious heat and extreme love unhappy Tellus who desire be so desperate that they be neither to be conceive of any creature nor to be cure by any art this I can breed slackness in love though never root it out what be he who you love and what she that he honour Endymion sweet Endymion be he that have my heart and Cynthia too too fair Cynthia the miracle of nature of time of fortune be the lady that he delight in and dote on every day and die for ten thousand time a day will you have his love either by absence of sickness aslake will you that Cynthia shall mistrust he or be jealous of he without colour it be the only thing I crave that see my love to Endymion unspotted can be accept his truth to Cynthia though it be unspeakable may be suspect I will undertake it and overtake he that all his love shall be doubt of and therefore become desperate but this will wear out with time that tread all thing down but truth let we go I follow
