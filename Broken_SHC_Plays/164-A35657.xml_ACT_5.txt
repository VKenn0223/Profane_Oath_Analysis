punishment for any fault but that he be thy son now not content to exceed all other tyrant exceed thyself first rob he of sight then seem by a feign and force repentance to expiate that crime do win he to a false security and now by poison have rob he of his life Were but my soul as pure from other guilt as that heaven do not hold one more immaculate yet what I have do he die do forgive i and

seem to threaten i there|be nobody it|be nothing but some fearful dream yes that|be my brother ghost who birthright stand betwixt i and empire like a spread cedar that grow to hinder some delightful prospect he I cut down next my old father ghost who I impatient to have my hope delay hasten by violence before his fatal day then my enrage son who seem to beckon and hale i to he I come I come you ghost the great of you all but sure one hell|be too little to contain i and too narrow for all my crime go muster all the citie-band pretend it to prevent sudden tumult but indeed to settle the succession my lord you be too sudden you|will take they unprepared alas you know their conscience be tender scandal and scruple must be first remove they must be pray and preach into a tumult but for the succession let we agree on that there|be Calamah the elder son by the arabian lady a gallant youth ay too gallant his proud spirit will disdain to owe his greatness to another gift such gift as crown transcend all requital turn injury no Mirvan he must be dull and stupid lest he know wherefore we make he king but he must be good nature tractable and one that will be govern and have so much wit to know who he|be behold to but why my lord shall you look further than yourself I have have some such thought but I consider the persian state will not endure a king so mean bear no I|will rather be the same I be in place the second but the first in power Solyman the son of the georgian lady shall be the man what noise be that my lord the prince late victorious army be march towards the palace breathe nothing but fury and revenge to they be join all who desire of change or discontent excite to new attempt their leader abdall and Morat Abdall and Morat Mirvan we be lose fall from the top of all our hope and cast away like sailor who escape sea and rock and tempest perish in|the very port so be we lose in|the sight and reach of all our wish How have our intelligence fail we so strange no no I know they be in mutiny but they can never have hurt we have they not come at this instant period this point of time have he live two day long a pardon to the captain and a largesse among the soldier have appease their fury have he die two day soon the succession have as we please be settle and secure by soffy death god that the world shall turn on minute and on moment my lord lose not yourself in passion but take counsel from necessity I|will to they and will let they know the prince be dead and that they come too late to give he liberty for love to he have breed their discontent I|will tell they bold that they have lose their hope and tell they too as they have lose their hope of|the one they have lose their fear of|the other tell their leader we desire their counsel in the next succession which if it meet disturbance than we shall crave assistance from their power which fate can not have send in a more happy hour my lord you hear the news the prince army be at the gate ay I hear it and feel it here but the succession that|be the point that first require your counsel who shall succeed but Soffy what in such time as these when such a army lie at our gate to choose a child our king you my lord Caliph be better read in story and can discourse the fatal consequence when child reign my lord if you|will be guide by reason and example my lord you come most opportune we be enter into dispute about the next succession who dare dispute it we have a powerful argument of forty thousand strong that shall confute he a powerful argument indeed ay such a one as will puzzle all your logic and distinction to answer it and since we come too late for the performance of our intend service to the prince the wrong prince we can more express our loyalty to he than in the right of his most hopeful son but be he not too young sure you think we so too but he and we be old enough to look through your disguise and under that to see his father enemy seize he and you that can show reason or example seize i for what can thou remember such a name as Mirza and ask for what that name I must remember and with horror but few have die for do what they have die for if they have not do it be the king command and I be only the|unhappy minister ay such a minister as wind to fire that add a accidental fierceness to its natural fury if it|be the king command it|be first thy malice command that command and then obey it nay if you have resolve it truth and reason be weak and idle argument but let i pity the unhappy instrument of prince will who anger be our fate and yet their love more fatal than their hate and how well that love have be requite Mirvan your confident by torture have confess the story of the king and of the pasha Mirvan poor-spirited wretch thou have deceive i nay then farewell my hope and next my fear what horrid noise be that of drum and trumpet that strike my ear what mean these bond can not my grandsire jealousy be satisfy upon his son but now must seize his dear favourite sure my turn come next it|be come already sir but to succeed he not they long live king Soffy but why be these man prisoner let this inform you but be my grandsire dead as sure as we be alive then let they still be prisoner away with they invite our mother from her sad retirement and all that suffer for my father love restraint or punishment dear mother make our happiness complete by break through that cloud of sorrow and let we not be want to ourselves now the heaven have do their part lest so severe and obstinate a sadness tempt a new vengeance sir to comply with you I|will use a violence upon my nature joy be such a foreigner so mere a stranger to my thought I know not how to entertain he but sorrow ill make by custom so habitual it|be now part of my nature but can no pleasure no delight divert it greatness or power which woman most affect if that can do it rule i and rule my empire sir seek not to rob i of my tear fortune herself be not so cruel for my counsel then may be unsuccessful but my prayer shall wait on all your action alas poor Solyman how be he alter I know not sir it a art your grandfather have to make i grow I think he take i for some crooked lady I|be sure the engine be better for the purpose than steel body or bolster but for what cause be all this cruelty why because I will not accuse your father when he see he can not stretch my conscience thus he have stretch my carcase I think they have stretch his wit too this be your father love that lie thus in my joint I may have love all the pocky whore in Persia and have feel it less in my bone thy faith and honesty shall be reward accord to thy own desire friend I pray thou tell i whereabout my knee be I will fain kneel to thank his majesty why sir for the present my desire be only to have a good bonesetter and when your majesty have do the office of a bonesetter to the body politic and some skilful man to this body of i which if it have be a body politic have never come to this I shall by that time think on something accord to my desert but must none of these great one be hang for their villainy yes certain then I need look no further some of their place will serve my turn bring back those villain now to your tear dear madam and the ghost of my dead father will I consecrate the first fruit of my justice let such honour and funeral rite as to his birth and virtue be due be first perform than all that be actor or author of so black a deed be sacrifice as victim to his ghost first thou my holy devil that can varnish so foul a act with the fair name of piety next thou the|abuser of thy prince ear sir I beg your mercy and I a speedy death nor shall my resolution disarm itself nor condescend to parley with foolish hope it|be cruelty to spare they I be sorry I must commence my reign in blood but duty and justice to my father soul exact this cruel piety let|we study for a punishment a feel one and borrow from our sorrow so much time to|invent a torment equal to their crime
