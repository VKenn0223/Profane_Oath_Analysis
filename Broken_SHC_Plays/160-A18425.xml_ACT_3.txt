fall I wish no blame but the|ill befall i make my fortune shame not i nor my fault we too well love Pompey to do he that injustice who more thirst the conquest then resolve to bear the foil say brutus-like give several witness all that you acquit i whatsoever fall particular man particular fate must bear who feel his own wound less to wound another leave he the worst who best be left undo he only conquer who mind still be one you sweet ease my charge yourselves unburden return not yet our trumpet send to know of Vibius certain state too long protract we all mean to recover his person quick or dead for I still think his loss serve fate before we blow retreat though some affirm he see soon after fight he bear a great mind to extend our pursuit much further than it be and serve that day when you have like the true head of a battle lead all the body in that glorious turn upon a far-off squadron that stand fast in conduct of the great Marc Anthony when all the rest be flee so past
