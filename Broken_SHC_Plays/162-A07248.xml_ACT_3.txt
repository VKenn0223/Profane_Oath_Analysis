her nuptial look on she again then tell i if she now appear the same that she be yesterday be herself she can but be excellent these rich and curious dress which in other may cover deformity from she take lustre nor can add to she you conceive she right and in your admiration of her sweetness you only can deserve she blush not girl thou be above his praise or i nor can obsequious flattery though she shall use her thousand oil tongue to advance thy worth give aught for that|be impossible but take from thy more than humane grace and even then when she have spend herself with her best strength the wrong she have do thou shall be so apparent that lose her own servile shape and name she will be think detraction but I forget myself and something whisper to i I have say too much I know not what

have stomach and wear new clothes nor live as now in hope of a cast gown or petticoat you be fool and ignorant of your happiness ere I be swear to the pantofle I have hear my tutor prove it by logic that a servant life be better than his master and by that I learn from he if that my memory fall not I|will make it good proceed my little wit in decimo sexto thus then from the king to the beggar by gradation all be servant and you must grant the slavery be less to study to please one than many true well then and first to you sir you complain you serve one lord but your lord serve a thousand beside his passion that be his worst master you must humour he and he be bind to soothe every grim sir above he if he frown for the least neglect you fear to lose your place but if and with all slavish observation from the minion self to the groom of his close stool he hourly seek not favour he be sure to be ease of his office though perhaps he buy it nay more that high disposer of all such that be subordinate to he serve and fear the fury of the many-headed monster the giddy multitude and as a horse be still a horse for all his golden trappings so your man of purchase title at their best be but servingman in rich livery most rare infant where learn thou this morality why thou dull pate as I can thou of my tutor now for we boy I be cut of the governor quick quick sir see all thing perfect let the blame be we else and as I say when we be at the banquet and high in our cup for it|be no feast without it especial among soldier Theocrine be retire as that|be no place for she take

I will attend the less and with all care observe and serve you this be a pen speech and serve as a perpetual preface to a dinner make of fragment we wait on you you be not merry sir yes my good lord you have give we ample mean to drown all care and yet I nourish strange thought which I will most willing destroy pray you take your place and drink a health and let it be if you please to the worthy of woman now observe he give i the bowl since you do i the honour I will begin it may we know her name sir you shall I will not choose a foreign queen nor yet our own for that will relish of tame flattery nor do their height of title or absolute power confirm their worth and goodness these be heaven gift and frequent confer on such as be beneath they nor will I name the king mistress howsoever she in his esteem may carry it but if I as wine give liberty may use my freedom not sway this way or that with confidence and I will make it good on any equal if it must be to she who outward form be better by the beauty of her mind she live not that with justice can pretend a interest to this so sacred health but my fair daughter he that only doubt it I do pronounce a villain this to she then what may we think of this it matter not for my part I will soothe he rather than draw on a quarrel Chamont it|be the safe course and one I mean to follow it have go round sir now you have do she right if there be any worthy to second this propose it bold I be your pledge let|we pause here if you please and entertain the time with something else music there in some lofty strain the song too that I

glorious habit that render a man complete what court so set off with state and ceremonious pomp but thus accoutre I may enter or what feast though all the element at once be ransack to store it with variety transcend the curiousness and cost on Traian birth day where prince only and confederate king do sit as guest serve and attend on by the senator of Rome sit with a soldier in this his natural and proper shape may not and bold fill a seat and by his present make the great solemnity more honour and remarkable it|be acknowledge and this a grace do to i unexpected but why in armour what|be the mystery pray you reveal that soldier out of action that very rare but like unbidden guest bring their stool with they for their own defence at court shall feed in gauntlet they may have their finger cut else there your carpet knight that never charge beyond a mistress lip be still most keen and valiant but to you who it do most concern my lord I will address my speech and with a soldier freedom in my reproof return the bitter scoff you throw upon my poverty you contemn my courser outside and from that conclude as by your groom you make i understand I be unworthy to sit at your table among these tissue and embroidery unless I change my habit I have do it and show myself in that which I have wear in the heat and fervour of a bloody fight and then it be in fashion not as now ridiculous and despise this have pass through a wood of pike and every one aim at it yet scorn to take impression from their fury with this as still you see it fresh and new I have charge through fire that will
