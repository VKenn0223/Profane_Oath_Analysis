Diana nymph and make her wanton and lascivious if Panthea be a goddess she must yield but tell i first how must it be apply and in what time will it begin to work lay it under the pillow of her bed and in a hour it will make she wake and yield I will now favour i infernal Jove So wake she not till she begin to smile now love begin to seat he in her brain a way I will not you be impudent tell i magician what import this speech why now she think some solicit she you be deceive I be not beautiful o give i leave to court she in her sleep it may be when she wake she will not love soft araspas if you talk she wake o let she wake I long to talk with she now begin her eye to open and she stir stand thou aside until I call for thou what dream and fond illusion have I have how come this word love in Panthea mind I love nay rather will I die then love and yet against my will I think on love oh Panthea think upon thy funeral for thou be wither with excessive grief love and deformity can agree if Panthea be fair and beautiful then love and Panthea do well agree araspas Panthea and herself will jar when she shall yield to love or what be love but gall and aloe to my martyr soul now Abradates be not in my sight here be araspas lovely Panthea for thou I|will leave the field then leave thou he for thou I|will leave the world then love thou i let Cyrus joy in pomp and empery suffice i to conquer fair Panthea let other glory in their ground and gold Panthea to i be twenty thousand world and without Panthea all the world be trash for thou araspas will I curse my star that suffer thou so to solicit i for thou I will count the world as hell except thou leave thus to solicit i how figurative be Panthea in her speech resemble cunning rhetorician who in the person of some one decease persuade their auditor to what they please I can think that these be Panthea word she be so fair to give so sharp reply but if these be the word of Panthea then must she change her face and seem less fair for know that beauty be love harbinger then be beauteous Panthea needs must love will I be change into some other shape that I may fright thou with my hideous look I in the person of myself decease protest this heart shall never harbour love but if my look be this preparative I|will beat my face against the hapless earth or deep harrow it with these my tremble hand which I hold up to heaven to change thy mind or hasten death to rid i from this suit nay then if amorous court will not serve know whether thou will or not I|will make thou yield though fortune make i captive yet know thou that Panthea will can never be constrain but torment can enforce a woman will then shall thy importunity enforce the sight of thou araspas shall constrain for I protest before the god of heaven no torment can be great in my thought ay say so till you feel they Panthea I feel more torment than thou can invent who add the more shall ease that I sustain all torment be they never so exquisite be but ascend step unto my end and death tu Panthea be a benefit what be thy threat but sugar promise then shall thou live and I|will importune thou ay now be Panthea menace to the proof yet every word thou speak shall wound my heart and in despite of thou I|will die at last the earnest thou be the soon too but to prevent it thus I will fly from thou Cyrus shall know Araspus villainy thus therefore shall I pine abandon love oh it|be inherent to araspas soul and thereby claim a immortality so it shall never begin nor never end a curse magician be these thy wicked spell o pardon i my honourable lord for Panthea virtue frustrate all my art must magic yield to virtue wherefore then do thou assure i she shall be in love So be she be asleep as do appear and why not be wake speak villain speak reason my lord be the predominant her intellectual part strive against love and magic can command the soul while appetite and common sense remain you see I make her smile embrace the air and show the affect of amorous conceit few woman use to skirmish with such thought and have this Panthea be at liberty she will have yield to your honour suit but in captivity be nought but grief and love with grief will keep no residence smooth be thy word but rough and harsh thy sense for they import Panthea can be force can thou with incantation make she die that she be go my love may follow she life be adjunct unto our human form exempt from magic and magician and that|be the cause we soon hurt brute beast than such as have the semblance of ourselves deceitful artisan thy word be sleight thy word deceitful and full of guile wit be a witch sweet word must conquer she out of my sight yet conceal this attempt if thou bewray it maugre all thy skill this sword shall send thou to eternal hell now be we at the bank of Euphrates far from the camp where soldier haunt and here may we under this poplar shade discourse upon the sweetness of our love you know my lord I be too young to love fair Alexandra if thou love not i thou be compact of adamant and iron thy year be fit for love so be thy look how fit soever my year be and my look I Alexandra be unfit to love be not my father with the persian king and I Alexendra as captive in his stead and give i leave to wail my hard estate and make a river with my flow tear that mingle with the stream of Euphrates may swift run unto my father seat and make he haste to great Antiochus nay rather sit upon this ledgy bank that I see thy shadow in the stream may feed my fancy with thy pleasant view if not enjoy the sweetness I desire and leap into the wave and drown myself that thou may pity Dinon be dead o I can pity Dinon be alive but that I fear my father will not come and then shall Alexandra suffer death and be dead Dinon may pity i love may I call thou love lo she do not frown her look give warrant for that appetite for thou I|will kneel before Antiochus and rather than thou shall be touch by he I|will bear thou hence as far as Tanais or keep thou close in these assyrian wood no place be secret to Antiochus do thou not know that king have reach hand I do yet know my sword be sharp and keen which when I draw and brandish in the air all Babylon will fight in my avail who honour i more than Antiochus I will not say how great thy dowry shall be nor boast what city I command let this though not a king in name in wealth and friend I be a emperor if I shall yield your honour may suppose that dignity and wealth shall conquer i therefore I blush to say I love my lord and when thou blush Dinon heart be fire therefore to quench it give a gentle grant my honour be preserve my grant be give thereof be I as chary as thyself and of thy love as of my proper life oh Alexandra thy word ravish i lull i asleep with sweetness of thy voice then shall my song be of my Dinon praise sleep Dinon than Libanio draw thy sword and manly thrust it in his slumber heart there be no way to save thy life but this and therefore fear not shall I slaughter he that entertain i with such amorous word such bounteous gift and golden promise when he shall know I be Libanio and go I can but I shall be take unless I slay he in his hapless sleep for he will quick wake and follow i now Dinon die alas I can strike this habit make i over pitiful Remember that thou be Libanio she kill he no woman but a bondman strike and fly now that Gobrias fortress be our own his daughter prisoner and his country burn let|we march from hence to wealthy Babylon and muster those resolve citizen to meet the persian in the open field twice have he lead his force by our gate yet never dare to mount his batter ram or warlike engine against the rampired wall therefore we he no more in garrison but bustle out and fight for liberty my lord behold where Dinon slaughter lie Dinon thou be decide it be not he it be my lord I know he by his scar these scar be give he in my father day and now he be dead ere I can guerdon he the great honour I can do

subdue be there no end of my calamity my father do to death by Cyrus sword wicked Gobrias and his daughter flee false Ctesiphon resolve to murder i and now Dinon my chief captain slay why run we not upon these persian which be the author of these misery Come soldier take he up and march away we|will empty Babylon to meet our foe and be revenge unto the nine degree both of Gobrias and his family exeunt o Cyrus if the fortune of thy hand have turn my freedom to captivity and of a queen make i a captive dame yet think that virtue be not thrall to chance nor honour subject to unhappy time but like a gallant consecrate ship that in extreme wrath and storm of sea vaunt all her sail and fight the battle out madam the reason of these vehement term Cyrus do neither know nor can conject it since
