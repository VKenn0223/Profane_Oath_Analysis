can object against we my dear daughter we dare dispute against this new spring sect in private or public my best lady persevere in it and what we maintain we will seal with our blood brave resolution I even grow fat to see my labor prosper I young again to your devotion do my prayer be present with you o my Harpax thou engine of my wish thou that steel my bloody resolution thou that arm my eye

people teach to obey and not compel with rigor the ancient roman discipline revive which raise room to her greatness and proclaim she the glorious mistress of the conquer world but above all the service of the god so zealous observe that good Sapritius in word to thank you for your care and duty be much unworthy Dioclesian honour or his magnificence to his loyal servant but I shall find a time with noble title to recompense your merit mighty Caesar who power upon this globe of earth be equal to love in heaven who victorious triumph on proud rebellious king that stir against it be perfect figure of his immortal trophy win in the giant war who conquer sword guide by his strong arm as deadly kill as do his thunder all that I have do or if my strength be centuple can do come short of what my loyalty must challenge but if in any thing I have deserve great Caesar smile it|be in my humble care still to preserve the honour of those god that make he what he be my zeal to they I ever have express in my fell hate against the christian sect that with one blow ascribe all thing to a unknown power will strike down all their temple and allow they nor sacrifice nor altar thou in this walk hand in hand with i my will and power shall not alone confirm but honour all that be in this most forward sacred Caesar if your imperial majesty stand please to shower your favour upon such as be the bold champion of our religion look on this reverend man to who the power of search out and punish such delinquent be by your choice commit and for proof he have deserve the grace impose upon he and with a fair and even hand proceed partial to none not to himself or those of equal nearness to himself behold this pair of virgin what be these his daughter now by your sacred fortune they be fair one exceed fair one will it|be in my power to make they i they be the god great lady they be most happy in your service else on these when they fall from their father faith I use a judge power entreaty fail they be seduce to win they to adore the holy power we worship I put on the scarlet robe of bold authority and as they have be stranger to my blood present they in the most horrid form all kind of torture part of which they suffer with Roman constancy and can you endure be a father to behold their limb extend on the rack I do but must confess there be a strange contention in i between the impartial office of a judge and pity of a father to help justice religion step in under which odds compassion fall yet still I be a father for even then when the flinty hangman whip be wear with stripe spend on their tender limb I kneel and weep and beg they though they will be cruel to themselves they will take pity on my grey hair now note a sudden change which I with joy remember those who torture nor fear of death can terrify be overcome by see of my suffering and so win return to the faith that they be bear in I give they to the god and be assure I that use justice with a rigorous hand upon such beauteous virgin and my own will use no favour where the cause command i to any other but as rock be deaf to all entreaty thou deserve thy place still hold it and with honour thing thus order touch the god it|be lawful to descend to human care and exercise that power heaven have confer upon i which that you rebel and traitor to the power of Rome shall not with all extremity undergo what can you urge to qualify your crime or mitigate my anger we be now slave to thy power that yesterday be king and have command over other we confess our grandsire pay you tribute yet leave we as their forefather have desire of freedom and if you roman hold it glorious honour not only to defend what be your own but to enlarge your empire though our fortune deny that happiness

be and be prepare to endure the worst that speak which now be high in fortune wheel must when she turn it next decline as low as we be This consider teach the egyptian Hercules Sesostris that have his chariot draw by captive king to free they from that slavery but to hope such mercy from a roman be mere madness we be familiar with what cruelty room since her infant greatness ever use such as she triumph over age nor sex exempt from her tyranny sceptre prince keep in your common dungeon and their child in scorn train up in base mechanic art for public bondman in the catalogue of those unfortunate man we expect to have our name remember in all grow empire even cruelty be useful some must suffer and be set up example to strike terror in other though far off but when a state be raise to her perfection and her base too firm to shrink or yield we may use mercy and do|it with safety but to who not coward or such who baseness shame the conqueror and rob he of his victory as weak
