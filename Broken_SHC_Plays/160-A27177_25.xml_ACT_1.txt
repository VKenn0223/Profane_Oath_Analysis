with such a slow and yet majestic pace as if he still call lowed dare none come on when sudden from a postern of the town two gallant horseman issue and overtake he the army look on yet not a man that dare relieve the rash adventurer which Lucio son to Alvarez then see as in the vanguard he sit brave mount or be it pity of the youth misfortune care to preserve the honour of his country or bold desire to get himself a name he make his brave horse like a whirl wind bear he among the combatant and in a moment discharge his petronel with such sure aim that of the adverse party from his horse one tumble dead then wheel round and draw a falchion swift as lightning he come on upon the other and with one strong blow in view of the amaze town and camp he strike he dead and bring Peralta off
