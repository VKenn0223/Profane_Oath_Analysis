here in this grove I leave she here among these poplar laurel and these sycamore guilty of her sad loss and yet behold they do appear as fresh and full of verdure as when my love clothe in her clear look do give they grace and lustre why do we poor silly man breed up in care and fear the nurse of our religion stoop to nature that only know to form not to preserve what she have make since careless of her work she leave to giddy fortune the whole power of rule we these senseless tree stand still and flourish too and in their pride upbraid my loss to i but my dear Sylvia be nature best piece make to excuse the rest of all her vulgar form ay i be leave to desolation till some horrid satyr breed in these wood and furious in his lust make she his prey and now have carry she into his dark retire or some cave where her poor Thyrsis never more shall see she but I will be revenge this wood that now be so bedeck with leaf and fresh array I|will level with the ground until it be as desolate as I it shall afford no shade to any thing that hither use to come for its relief but henceforth be for ever infamous that when some gentle shepherd pass by and see this ground rend with the crooked plough here he may say here it|be that Sylvia be lose and then shall turn another way good Thyrsis do not make so much of grief you|have feed it with too many tear already take comfort now what have my present state to do with comfort if you see the tree widow of leaf the earth grow hard and spoil of the green mantle which she wont to wear you wonder not if winter then appear and must I when she be go who sunlike eye do cherish a everlasting summer in my life feel any spring of joy to comfort i no father grief with i be best in season all as the shepherd be such be his flock so pine and languish they as in despair he pine and languish their fleecy lock let hang disorder as their master hair since she be go that deck both he and they and now what beauty can there be to live when she be lose that do all beauty give but yet methinks for one that be a stranger scarce know to any here but by her name these plaint be overmuch beside there be in fruitful arcady as fair as she I|be sure more rich and wise make out of they a choice Nerina be as fair as she Dorinda flock be more than Silvia and carry on their back more wool than she let such base peasant as the god do hate admire their wealth and they for what they have their body and their soul material alike of drossy substance be compound and can contemplate nothing but the earth no Silvia who some better God perhaps for the reward of my well tune pipe send down to i make up of air and fire though since because I know not how to use with fair respect a gift so great as she have just reave she from i be so much so great a part of i that in her absence amid my grief I feel some little joy to see how much of i each minute waste and give i hope that when I shall dissolve this earthly substance and be pure as she for sure the god have take her undefiled I may enjoy her look and though it be profane to touch a hallow thing like she I may adore she yet and recompense with my religion the proud thought I have once to enjoy she see how fond you be to|embrace a shadow and to leave the substance the love of Hylas to Nerina have more hope than you though she be young and coy yet while Nerina be and Hylas too one time or other they may both have joy may they prove happy in each other love and nothing please but what each other do for so live Thirsis and his Silvia while Silvia be and Thirsis be her love whatever Thirsis pipe please Silvia Thirsis admire whatever Sylvia sing and both their joy be equal or but one well I can now remember and it be some comfort to remember what I moan that when our love begin how first I gaze on she and she be please that I shall look till greedy I have devour the hook love give i courage then to speak my thought and give her pity to receive my word they link our heart together from that time when ere she see i strike the furious boar though then my case she rue and sigh full oft yet be she please to see my victory and I receive my vigour from her eye then will she make i chaplet of the best and choice flower to adorn my head which when I wear methinks I then do grasp the empire of the world but what of that the more I then enjoy of heavenly bliss the more my present grief and passion be well Thyrsis since my word do but renew the story of your grief I|will leave to use persuasion to you for it|be time I see and not my word must cure your malady that time must put a period to my life or else it never will unto my grief come boy and under this same hang bow the note which thou attemper to my word sing and be happy than thy master boy shall I because my love be go accuse those golden dart which to a bless union strike our two love heart since fortune and not love have cause my moan no her pure image I shall prize imprint in my breast more than the fair mistress eye that ever swain possess which in eternal bond my fancy tie Come then you sharp grief and try if you can pierce my heart but use if you will have i die the best you can of art to wound a breast so arm with constancy enough I|will sigh the rest out go my boy be careful of thy tender lamb while I seek out some hide place to pine and die believe Mirtillus never any love be buy with other price then love alone since nothing be more precious than itself it be the pure abstract of that fire which wise Prometheus first endue we with and he must love that will be love again why who can say Mirtillus do not love Mirtillus he who have employ his youth ever in service of the fair nymph no gentle Hylas this ribbon and this hair you see i wear be they not ensign of a lover say what shepherdess who ever swain think fair have not Mirtillus court and obtain some favour from but you will think because I do not fold my arm and sigh and spend the day the god have give i to rejoice in whine passion walk still alone now proud with hope then cast down with despair unequal to myself in every thing I can love no Hylas know I love Dorinda Cloris Amarillis all who ever love do to his altar call and when this mistress frown I be content to take another when that flame be spend by time or put out by a rival straight a three supply her place perhaps more worthy if less because she love I|will think she so Alas Mirtillus I do pity thou pity the error which thou wander in that think thou love and know not what it be I know Mirtillus that no lover yet purchase a last pleasure without grief for love have gall in it as well as honey and so compound that whosoever will taste the sweet of it must take the bitter too out of both which be make our constancy you that embrace the false delight alone be a feign lover or more true none I know not what you mean by constancy I|be sure I love the fair still you err for if you love the fair none have be the object of your choice but my Nerina Nerina she the glory of these wood the only subject of all shepherd song she have her share of beauty with the rest and I confess she|be fit for love as any but why she only shall take up your breast and shut out all that have a right as good who equal or transcendent beauty plead as just a title to|it as she can do I can reach the reason but admire your faith and what you praise your constancy Mirtillus though I know your stubborn heart can never entertain a lover think yet do I think you will have be more tender how you profane a name so sacred as nerina be who never any swain nor rural God nor satyr though he be of savage kind will ever violate Nerina in who form love ever dwell attend by the grace which do range themselves in order about her comely face who breast without be hill of white snow within the seat of blameless modesty regard of honour and pure chastity nor may a loose thought ever harbour there to tempt such lover as you seem to be be it for that you slight she no I love she as I do other with who I compare she but you that love with such intemperance make of your love a glass wherein you see each thing much great than indeed it be my love too cold you say but I be sure you be too hot for any to endure a mean perhaps betwixt these I may approve but while we talk thus see the flame have catch you your beauteous flame Nerina be at hand Dorinda with she dare you stay the|encounter DOrinda I have miss the chase today such be my chance and he that lodge the dear tell i it be the fair in these wood the god do love you sure that have leave your thought so free for sport i be not so that angry God pursue i in his fury and force i to love where I be scorn hapless Dorinda why shall he despise thou many a swain and many a rural God have seek thy favor and have seek in vain now thou be just punish with disdain trust i sweetheart I can choose but wonder to think that one of such a comely grace I do not flatter you can sue to any for love who be much fit to be love scorn he as|much as he do thou for man love we no more when we love they again ah good Nerina you have speak truth it may warn other nymph by my example how they profess their love to any man I|be past the cure he that wound i have leave i quite disarm and rob i of all those defensive art which man will say be natural and proper to our sex I can change a face or weep one tear or laugh against my will so violent my fate have thrust i to this love that all my faculty confess their weakness and my flame be get so much above my reach I can not put it out nor smother it alas poor wench tell i who be the man make up of so much rigid cruelty that I may shun he wheresoever I go I hear he boast to every shepherd and to every nymph how much I love he Venus forgive i if I do disclose he but he will do|it himself it|be he Nerina Daphnis that woe my father to win i he be my daily suitor now I know how much he owe to pity and to thou until he pay that debt I shall despise he love he I know no great misery then to love one that|be not of humane race a tiger rather but a tiger be more mild than he for love sake say not so he have a manly feature and do show as much of grace in his comportment as the best of shepherd can he Titan make of better clay than he do other man although his heart be flint and hard rock yet be his heart so hard or be my part rather unequal to his high desert for he can love I see since you he love and you deserve it have he think i worthy he will have love i too but as I be worthless Dorinda I be make his scorn and I have rather be so than Nerina shall want a servant such as Daphnis be prithee no more of he I hate his name as much as I will do the loss of honour which he injurious will rob i off no no Dorinda if by love I be enthrall to any Daphnis be not he yes many that I can tell how to love rather than he for why shall I love he while Hylas live and languish for i Hylas who love i in my infancy and be then a boy be never well if I be absent nor indeed be I content with any but his company our flock still feed together I on he and he on i do feed his greedy eye since though his year have style he man he have continue that first love with such respect so full of innocence and simple truth that howsoever my outward coyness be my heart within tell i it|be only his ay i my father prithee let|we away Pan be as cruel to his flock and he as he have be to i go leave your curse and follow she let i alone with he ha have I find you hoh Nerina stay your father call you be not that my daughter that make away so fast who she that|be go believe your eye no more they be false to you can you take one for she that|be nothing like she it|be Cloris go from we I dare have swear that she have be my daughter what make she here it|will never be otherwise young woman will be chat with young man whatever their father say it be not so when I be young a boy as you be shepherd we never dare keep company with woman nor they with we each one do careful attend his charge and when the time be come that we grow ripe in year and be stay youth our father will provide we wife we do not carve for ourselves as now a day they do but now our child think themselves as wise nay wise than their father and will rule they they can no soon peep out of the shell but they must love forsooth I will fain know whether it|be fit a maid shall be in love I speak now of that skittish girl my daughter before she ask her father leave and like it|be true Charinus it|be not fit indeed who shall bestow the daughter but the father but shepherd do you never hear that once there be a age the near to the god a age we rather praise than imitate when no man will nor woman be enforce to any bent but its own motion each follow nature law and by instinct do love the fair and enjoy their wish love than not tie to any interest of blood or fortune hasten to his end without control nor do the shepherd number her sheep that be his choice but every grace that do adorn her beauteous mind or face riches with love then be not value pure uncompounded love that can despise the whole world riches for a mistress eye pray tell i Daphnis you be young and handsome the lover of our fair nymph Nerina will you for all that fruitful Sicily can yield or all the wealth of Persia change one poor lock of your fair mistress hair while she be you and you her shepherd be son son she shall be you why be not I her father she my daughter may not I bestow she where I please yes if she like the man she will bestow herself never fear it what she bestow herself without my leave no no Mirtillus you mistake my daughter I can get she once to think of marriage and true I do muse to see a wench that in all other thing although I say it have wit at will can pin her sheep in fold as well as any know when to drive they home and there she can do twenty thing as well yet when I speak to she of marriage she turn the head she|will be a dryad she or one of those fond nymph of Diane train old man believe she not she mean not so she love to keep the thing for which she be so much belove I mean her maidenhead which while she have she know to play the tyrant and make we slave unto her scornful look for beauty then itself most justify when it be court if not love it die well we will think of this come Daphnis come I see you love my daughter and you only shall have she it be I that tell you so that be her father thank you good Charinus but I have rather she have tell i so alas poor shepherd by these we know that season but while you mourn thus who look to
