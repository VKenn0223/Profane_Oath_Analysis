fair design of love with all the soft behaviour of a princess but it|be not impossible a lady shall dissemble Allow she but the honour she be bear with and she|will not stain her blood so much but love must be obey and prepossession of heart be a lewd thing to wrestle with I make it my own case and if I love another lady better than the princess as every man|be not proof against all beauty I think I shall be constant too it will be something to remove I then the king he know not and I have bind myself in honour not to betray if they be decree to make a marriage a soft destiny attend their love there be some mystery but will you rest and take for grant she do love Montalto if it be a truth you|be in the same condition when she confirm it it|be not good to be busy in search of these

many prayer that she may live the darling of his heart I|will change my acquaintance of this world to be at peace in my own ash you will not commit a violence upon yourself I shall not need the thought of she will kill I with as much silence as I go to sleep I only shall bleed inward and my life remove itself like a fair apparition that vanish to the|eye and with less noise than a calm summer evening but when I be dead it|be not impossible some may report Theodosia be but ravish from i fear of a brother anger and the trick of politic state that marry to knit power not heart do force she to herares arm while I tear from the branch where I once grow travel I know not whether in the air I begin to think he worth some pity into what vain thing will the severe apprehension of grief transform we coward let the duke move with all amorous haste to his delight and glory in the hope of his fair bride i by the gift of heaven and heart but all my flower grow dull on their stalk and wither let she gay paranymph with rosy chaplet which will take all their colour from her blush attend on Theodosia to the temple while as they go no rude wind shall be hear but so much breath of heaven as gentle may lift their loose hair up whisper my wrong to every virgin care let they be marry knit hand and plight a ceremonious faith let all the triumph waste let they be waste and night
