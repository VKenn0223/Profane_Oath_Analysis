Calli-mahi epigr. de Timone keep hateful man from tread Timon grave reader be go inquire no more of i a curse upon thou whatsoever thou be good good o Timon Athens never can boast a wise philosopher but thou thou know the nature of all man that all be false true Timon true they be all knave indeed thou wise hate that wicked thing call man who other force philosopher admire and call a noble creature and partaker of divine nature they be fool fool Timon all other sect be fool and I will follow no sect but thou I be a Timonist that|be not enough Timon himself I be yonder he sit see Aristocrates how much unlike that great Antonius who person late so many legion guard so many king attend as their lord Antonius where thou be deceive Lucilius that|be Timon man how can thou jest at this this woeful passion which alone|be enough to melt his foe and Caesar into tear we feed this foolish passion to give way and keep aloof thus I|will go to he Timon ha what be thou be go I say from i get you to Caesar man I hate you all I hate thou Timon do thou think it|be love have bring i hither I be come to vex thou why do thou think i so unnatural to love a man but may we not love woman yes

intend once for man to come and hang themselves I|will keep a bawdy house a better way by far it|will ruin more I wonder Timon at that foolish plot that I have hear that in thy garden once in Athens thou do set up gallow for man in discontent to hang themselves how few think thou will be so mad to do it but to a wench they|will come and then the office that thou shall have will be of more account for where have you a man of any fashion that now adays turn hangman but a pandar be on employment that befit a statesman a thing require good part and gravity I|will try that course but it|be too slow a plot o for a speedy way to kill the world I have do somewhat in my day my war and bloody battle be not make in vain for I be once Antonius and a roman as in the war of Troy Pythagoras before that transmigration of his soul have be Euphorbus and when I be triumvir first at Rome that be a time indeed than I can hear of those good deed which must be still a comfort to your good conscience though they be past when Rome be fill with slaughter flow with blood but they perchance be knave that be proscribe and may have do more mischief have they live behold the list but one among the rest most comfort i that talk fellow Cicero that use to tax the vicious time and be forsooth a lover of his country out upon he than he be right serve for be it fit in a well govern state such man shall live as love their country have it not be for he Catiline plot have thrive it|be true I|be sure Caesar be on that side he favour it yes Caesar understand himself there|be hope that this young Caesar too will prove as good a patriot as ere his father be he will do reason man he be of nature cruel enough in that proscription it do appear but now he|will reign alone o for such faction as be then afoot to rend the state and fill the world with slaughter none talk with he but Aristocrates who follow his own way and suit just with his conceit think to reclaim he so the news that I shall bring will make he worse and fright that little reason that be leave quite from his breast it can so Canidius perchance to hear the|extremity of all will cure his fit it can make he worse for death itself be better and more noble how weak a thing be man that seat his hope in fortune slippery and unconstant favour and seek no sure strength to guard his soul want a strong foundation he be shake with every wind overthrow by every storm and what so frequent as those storm in fortune who fair weather never bring assurance of perpetuity but come what will I|will tell he all well Alcibiades I be resolve I|will
