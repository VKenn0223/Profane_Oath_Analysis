impossible it be to conceal our affection as to resist thy force I know that where my arrow light there breed love but shoot every minute a thousand shaft I know not on who heart they light though they fall on no place but heart what be your mistress Ceres maiden my most cruel which she call constancy my most fair but most proud my most witty but most waver be the one cruel the|other coy the three inconstant too cruel too coy too fickle what do they think of Cupid one say he have no eye because he hit he know not who the|other that he have no ear to hear those that call the three that he have no nose for savour be not find of lover all that he have no taste because sweet and sour be all one all that he have no sense because pain be pleasure and pleasure pain all that he be a foolish god work without reason and suffer the repulse without regard dare they blaspheme my godhead which jove do worship Neptune reverence and all the god tremble at to make they love be a revenge too gentle for Cupid to make you hate a recompense too small for lover but of that anon what have you use in love all thing that may procure love gift word oath sigh and swoon what say they of gift that affection can not be buy with gold what of word that they be golden blast out of leaden bellows what of oath that jupiter never swear true to Juno what of sigh that deceit keep a forge in the heart of fool what of swoon Nothing but that they wish they death what reason give they not to love woman reason they will not because they will not well then shall you see Cupid requite their reason with his rigour what punishment do you desire that Cupid will deny Mine be so hard as stone will I have turn to stone that be to lover pitiless she may to all the world be senseless Mine be so fair and so proud will I have turn into some flower that she may know beauty be as fade as grass which be fresh in the morning be wither before night my divine Cupid who affection nothing can make stay let she be turn to that bird that live only by air and die if she touch the earth because it be constant the bird of paradise Cupid that draw in her bowel nothing but air she may know her heart feed on nothing

flint because thy heart be of marble thy ear shall be hole for fish who ear be more deaf than fish thou Celia who beauty make proud shall have the fruit of beauty that be to fade while it be flourish and to blast before it be blow thy face as fair as the damask rise shall perish like the damask rise the canker shall eat thou in the bud and every little wind blow thou from the stalk and then shall man in the morning wear thou in their hat and at night cast thou at their heel thou Niobe who nothing can please but that which most displease Cupid inconstancy shall only breathe and suck air for food and wear feather for silk be more waver than air and light than feather this will Cupid do therefore when next you shall behold your lady do but send a faithful sigh to Cupid and there shall arise a thick mist which Proserpina shall send and in the moment you shall be revenge and they change Cupid prove himself a great god and they peevish girl with what sacrifice shall we show ourselves
