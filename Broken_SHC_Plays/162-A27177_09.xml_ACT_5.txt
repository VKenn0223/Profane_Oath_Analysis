gloss to their bad cause by be present with they but I that yet taste of the punishment in be false to Pompey will not make a second fault to Caesar uncompelled with such as have not yet shake off obedience I yield myself to you and will take part in all your danger This plead your excuse and I receive it if they have any touch of justice or religion I will use the authority of our god to call they back from their bad purpose this part of the palace be yet defensible we may make it good till your power rescue we Caesar besiege o stain to my great action it|be my custom a army rout as my foot have wing to be first in the chase nor wall nor bulwark can guard those that escape the battle fury from this strong arm and I to be enclose my heart my heart but it|be necessity to which the god must yield and I obey till I redeem it by some glorious way exeunt there|be no retire now we be break in the deed past hope of pardon if we prosper he will be style lawful and we shall give law to those that now command we stop not at or loyalty or duty bold ambition to dare and power to do give the first difference between the king and subject Caesar motto aut Caesar aut nihil each of we must claim and use it as our own the deed be bloody if we conclude in Ptolemy death the better the globe of empire must be so manure Rome that from Romulus first take her name have her wall water with a crimson shower drain from a brother heart nor be she raise to this prodigious height that overlook three full part of the earth that pay her tribute but by enlarge of her narrow bound by the sack of neighbour city be make she till they be cement with the blood of those that do possess they Cesar Ptolemy now I be steel to i be empty name esteem as Pompey be Well say Septinius thou now be right

triumvirate government once confirm she bear her brother company that|be my province leave i to work she I will undertake for Ptolemy Cesar shall be my task and as in Pompey I begin a name I|will perfect it in Caesar it|be resolve then we|will force our passage see they do appear as they desire a parley I be proud yet I have bring they to capitulate now Photinus now Ptolemy no addition we be equal though Caesar name be put into the scale in which our worth be weigh presumptuous villain upon what ground have thou presume to raise thy servile hand against the king or i that have a great name on those by which thou do presume to pass the Rubicon against the law of Rome and at the name of traitor smile as thou do when Marcellus the consul with the senate full consent pronounce thou for a enemy to thy country yet thou go on and thy rebellious cause be crown with fair success why shall we fear then think on that Caesar o the god be brave thus and be compel to bear this from a slave that will not brook great Pompey his superior thy glory now have touch the high point and must descend despair and think we stand the champion of Rome to wreak her wrong upon who liberty thou have set thy foot and that the ghost of all those noble roman that by thy sword fall in this civil war expect revenge dare thou speak and remember there be a Pompey there be no hope to escape we if that against the odds we have upon you you dare come forth and fight receive the honour to die like roman if you faint resolve to starve like wretch I disdain to change exit another syllable with you let we die noble and rather fall upon each other sword then come into these villain hand that fortune which to this hour have be a friend to Caesar though for a while she clothe her brow with frown will smile again upon i who will pay she or sacrifice or vow if she forsake her best of work in i or suffer he who with a strong hand she have lead triumphant through the whole western world and Rome acknowledge her sovereign lord to end in glorious a life admire by all the threaten danger must by a way more horrid be avoid and I will run the hazard fire the palace and the rich magazine that neighbour it in which the wealth of Egypt be contain start not it shall be so that while the people labour in quench the ensue flame like Caesar with this handful of my friend through fire and sword I force a passage to my conquer legion king if thou dare follow where Caesar lead or live or die a freeman if not stay here a bondman to thy slave and dead be think unworthy of a grave exeunt I feel my resolution melt again and that I be not knave alone but fool in all my purpose this devil Photinus employ i as a property and grow useless will shake i off again he tell i so when I kill Pompey nor can I hope better when Caesar be dispatch service do for such as only study their own end too great to be reward or return with deadly hate I learn this principle in his own school yet still he fool i well and yet he trust i since I in my nature be fashion to be false wherefore shall I that kill my general and a roman one to who I owe all nourishment of life be true to a egyptian to save Caesar and turn Photinus plot on his own head as it be in my power redeem my credit and live to lie and swear again in fashion o it|be a masterpiece ha my Ceasar how|be he get off the fire have take and show the

lie but two hour conceal if you believe he he|will bury we alive I|will fly in the air first then in the dead of night I|will bring you back into a private room where you shall find Photinus and Achillas and the rest of their commander close at counsel good what follow fall i fair on their throat their head cut off and shear the multitude will easy disperse o devil away with he nor true to friend nor enemy Caesar scorn to find his safety or revenge his wrong so base a way or owe the mean of life to such a leprous traitor I have tower for victory like a falcon in the cloud not dig for|it like a mole our sword and cause make way for we and that it may appear we take a noble course and hate base treason some soldier that will merit Caesar favour hang he on yonder turret and then follow
