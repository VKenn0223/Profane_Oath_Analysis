come Metron say of who have thou receive the|intelligence of this conspiracy contrive against our person as thou say by Dymnus and some other of the camp be|it not some vain report bear without cause that envy or imagination draw from private end to breed a public fear to|amuse the world with thing that never be here may it please your highness be the man one Ceballinus that bring i the news o Alexander I have save thy life I be the man that have reveal their plot and how come thou to be inform thereof by my own brother one Nichomacus who Dymnus chief of the conspirator acquaint with the

guard take and lay he present in hold o may it please your grace I do not keep the thing conceal one hour but present run to acquaint Philotas therewithal suppose he a man so near in place will best respect a case that touch so near and on he have I wait these two day expect to|have be bring unto your grace and see he weigh it light pretend that your grace leisure serve not fit to hear ay to the master of your armoury address myself forthwith to Metron here who without make any more delay press in unto your grace be in your bath lock i up the while in the|armoury and all what I can show reveal have if this be so then fellow I confess thy loyal care of we be more than they who have more reason they shall have be more cause Dymnus to be present bring forth and call Philotas straight who now I see have not deceive i in deceive i who will have think one who I hold so near will from my safety have be so far off when most it shall and ought import his care and wherein his allegiance may make proof of those effect my favour have deserve and ought to|have claim more due at his hand then any of the rest but thus we|be serve when private grace out of proportion stand and that we call up man from of below from the|element of base property and set they where they may behold and know the way of might and work of majesty where see those ray which be send far off reflect a heat of wonder and respect to fail near hand and not to show that proof the object only work that effect think see themselves though by our favour set within the self same orb of rule with we their light will shine alone if we be set and so presume to|obscure or shadow we but he shall know although his nearness have not feel our heat that we can burn he too and grace that shine can kindle unto wrath and Alexander and the king be two but here they bring we Dymnus in who face I see be gild despair horror and death yea death indeed for ere he can be|attach he stab himself so deadly to the heart as it|be impossible that he shall live say Dymnus what have I deserve of thou that thou shall think worthy to be thy king Philotas then ourself hold hold he sink guard keep he up get he to answer we he|have speak his last he|will never answer more sorry I be for that for now have death shut we clean out from know he within and lock up in his breast all the|other heart but yet this deed argue the truth in gross though we be bar it in particular Philotas be you come look here this man this Ceballinus shall have suffer death can it but have be prove he have conceal the|intend treason from we these two day wherewith he say he straight acquaint thou think the more near thou be about ourself the great be the shame of thy offence and which have be less foul in he then thou renown prince for that my heart be clear amazement can overcast my face and I must bold with the|assure cheer of my unguilty conscience tell your grace that this offence thus happen be not make by any the least thought of ill in i and that the keep of it unbewrayed be that I hold the rumor vain to be consider some who be accuse be know your ancient and most loyal servitor and such as rather will let out their own heart blood I know then once endanger you and for i then upon no certain note but on the brabble of two wanton youth to|have tell a idle tale that will have wrought in your distrust and wrong to other truth and to no end but only to have make myself a scorn and odious unto all for which I rather take the bait be lay then else for any treachery at all I must confess I think the safe way to smother it a while to the end I may if such a thing can be some proof bewray that may yield probability of right protest that my own unspotted thought a like belief of other truth do breed judge no impious wretch can have be wrought to|imagine such a detestable deed and therefore oh dread sovereign do not way Philotas faith by this his oversight but by his action past and only lay error to|his charge not malice not despite well lo thou have a favourable judge when though thou have not power to clear thy blame yet have he power to pardon thou the same which take not as thy right but as his grace since here the person alter not the case and here Philotas I forgive the|offence and to confirm the same lo here|be my hand o sacred hand the witness of my life by thou I hold my safety as secure as be my conscience free from treachery well get your charge and look to our affair for we tomorrow purpose to remove in troth I know not what to judge herein methinks the man seem sure clear in this however otherwise his hope have be transport by his unadvisedness it can be a guilty conscience shall put on so sure a brow or else by art his look stand neutral seem not to hold respondency of interest with his heart sure for my part he have dissolve the knot of my suspicion with so clear a hand as that I think in this whatever plot of mischief it may be he have no hand my lord the great confidence he show who be suspect shall be fear the more for danger from weak nature never grow who must disturb the world be build therefore he more be to be fear that nothing fear and malice most effect that least appear presumption of man power as well may breed assuredness as innocency may and mischief seldom but by trust do speed who king betray first their belief betray I will your grace have first confer with we since you will needs such clemency have show that we may yet but have advise you thus that he his danger never may have know in fault wherein a after shame will live it|be better to conceal then to forgive for who be bring unto the block of death think rather on the peril they have pass then on that grace which have preserve their breath and more their suffering then their mercy taste he now to plot your danger still may live but you his guilt not always to forgive know that a man so swell with discontent no grace can cure nor pardon can restore he know how those who once have mercy spend can never hope to have it any more but say that through remorse he calm prove will great Parmenio so attend on with that brave army foster in his love be thankful for this grace you do his son some benefit be odious so be this where man be still ashamed to confess to have so do as to deserve to die and ever do desire that man shall guess they rather have receive a injury than life since life they know in such a case may be restore to all but not to grace and for my part my liege I hold this mind that sure he will not have so much suppress the notice of a treason in that kind unless he be a party with the rest can it be think that great parmenios son the general commander of the horse the minion of the camp the only one of secret counsel and of free recourse shall not in three day space have find the king at leisure to|hear three word of that import while he himself in idle lavish do thousand spend to|advance his own report and if he give no credit to the youth why do he two day space delay he then as if he have believe it for a truth to hinder his address to other man if he have hold it but a vain conceit I pray why have he not dismiss he straight Men in their private danger may be stout but in the|occasion and the fear of king we ought not to be credulous but doubt the intimation of the vain thing well howsoever we will yet this night disport and banquet in unusual wise that it may seem we weigh this practice light however heavy here within it lie king may not know distrust and though they fear they must not take acquaintance of their fear o you|be a secret council-keeper Thais in troth I little think you such a one and why Antigona what have I do you know full well your conscience you bewray alas good soul will you have i conceal that which yourself can not but needs reveal think you another can be more to you in what concern they not than you can be who it import will other hold they true when you prove false to your own secrecy but yet this be no wonder for we see wise than we do lay their head to gauge for riotous expense of their tongue although it be a property belong especial to we and every age can show strange precedent what we have be in case of the great plot of man and it|be the scene on this world stage we play who revolution we with man convert and be to act our part as well as they though common the weak yet apart for this great motion of a state we see do turn on many wheel and some though small do yet the great move who in degree stir those who likewise turn the great of all for though we be not wise we see the wise by we be make or make we party still in action of the great quality that they can manage be they good or ill I can tell but you have make i do that which must ever more afflict my heart and if this be my woeful part to|undo my dear love will I have have no part how have I seely woman sift be examine try flatter terrify by Craterus the cunning of man that never leave i till I have descry whatever of Philotas I have know what be that all perhaps I have thereby do thou more good than thou can apprehend such good I rather you shall get than I if that can be a good to|accuse my friend Alas thy accusation do but quote the margin of some text of great note but that be more than thou or I can tell yes yes Antigona I know it well for be thou sure that always those who seek to|attack the lion so provide that still their toil be such as that he shall not scape to turn his rage on those that wrought his ill Philotas neither be so strong nor high but malice overlook he and descry where he lie weak where be his vanity and build her countermount upon that side in such sort as they will be sure to raze his fortune with the engine of disgrace and now may thou perhaps come great hereby and gracious with his great enemy for such man think they have no full success unless they likewise gain the mistress of those they master and succeed the place and fortune of their love with equal grace love|be out alas love such a one as he that seek to|undo my love and in he i tush love his fortune love his state his place whatever greatness do it must have grace I weigh not greatness I must please my eye the|eye nothing fair see than dignity but what be dignity without our love if we have that we can want our love why that give but the outside of delight the daytime joy what comfort have the night if power procure not that what can it do I know not how that can be|attain unto nor will I teach thou if thou know it not it|be vain I see to learn a asian wit if this be that great wit that learned skill you greek profess let i be foolish still so I be faithful and now be here alone let i record the heavy note of moan my lord you see the flexible conceit of our endanger sovereign and you know how much his peril and Philotas pride import the state and we and therefore now we either must oppose against deceit or be undo for now have time descry a open passage to his far end from whence if negligence now put we back return we never can without our wrack and good my lord since you conceive as much and that we stand alike make not i prosecute the cause alone as if it do but touch only myself and that I do both breed and urge these doubt out of a private grief Indeed I know I may with much more ease sit still like other and if danger come may think to shift for one as well as they but yet the faith the duty and respect we owe both to our sovereign and the state my lord I hold require another care my lord assure you we will take a time to urge a strict count of Dymnus death my lord I say unless this be the time you will apply your physic after death you see the king invite have this night Philotas with the rest and entertain he with as kind a usage to our sight as ever and you see the cunning strain of sweet insinuation that be use to|allure the ear of grace with false report so that all this will come to be excuse with one remove one action quite transport the king affection over to his hope and set he so beyond the due regard of his own safety as one enterprise may serve their turn and may we all surprise but now since thing thus of themselves break out we have advantage to prevent the worst and every day will yield we more no doubt for they be save that thus be warn first so my lord Clitus be they likewise warn to|accelerate their plot be thus bewray but that they can now it be too late for treason take ere the birth do come abortive and her womb be make her tomb you do not know how far it have put forth the force of malice nor how far be spread already the contagion of this ill why then there may some one be torture of those who Ceballinus bath reveal whereby the rest may be discover that one must be Philotas from who head all this corruption flow take he take all Philotas be not name and therefore may perhaps not be acquaint with this plot that his conceal of the plot betray and if we do not cast to find he first his wit be sure bath lay so good a ground as he will be the last that will|be find but if he be not find then in this case we do he more by injure his grace if that he be not find to|have deal in this yet this will force out some such thought of he as will undo he for you seldom see such man arraign that ever quit be well my lord Craterus we will move his grace though it be late before he take his rest that some course may be take in this case and God ordain it may be for the best see how these great-man clothe their private hate in those fair colour of the public good and to effect their end pretend the state as if the state by their affection stand and arm with power and prince jealousy will put the least conceit of discontent into the great rank of treachery that no one action shell seem innocent yea valour honour bounty shall be make as accessary unto end unjust and even the service of the state must lade the needful undertake with distrust so that base vileness idle luxury seem safe far than to do worthy suspicion full of eye and full of ear do through the tincture of her own conceit see all thing in the colour of her fear and truth itself must look like to deceit that what way ever the suspect take still envy will most cunning forelay the ambush of their ruin or will make their humour of themselves to take that way but this be still the fate of those that be by nature or their fortune eminent who either carry in conceit too far do work their own or other discontent or else be deem sit to be suppress not for they be but that they may be ill since state have ever have far more unrest by spirit of worth than man of mean skill and find that those do always better prove who|be equal to employment not above for self opinion will be see more wise than present counsel custom order law and to the end to have they otherwise the common wealth into combustion draw as if ordain to|embroil the world with wit aswell as grossness to dishonour it
