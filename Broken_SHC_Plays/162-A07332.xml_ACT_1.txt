now be the time noble Vitellius for you and you most honour Pollio to make that service you have do complete to royal Agrippina brief thus the two commander of|the praetorian camp Crispinus Rufus and that Lucius Geta must be displace and some of near trust to her design advance in their room or else our power will never be full they love Britannicus too well this be the thing the empress wish let your eloquence and wisdom further it in Caesar ear fear we not Pallas but what successor have we to take their charge one must take all you may pretend the inconvenience of two commander and so take from Caesar all jealousy of the plot Burrhus Afranius a wise valiant man belove and honour by the soldier none can except against he and the change will not displease the camp nor can his merit make he less thankful to she know well it|be in her power to make it otherwise but the advance of such able man as Seneca and Burrhus will take off all envy from the empress and ourselves then we with praise have wrought our purpose and make our party strong while Seneca shall sway the senate Burrhus rule the camp to her design but I|will presume no far to|instruct your wisdom or much less to doubt your true affection to the state and honour of Agrippina who will then have power to make more large requital to her friend in which most high and happy rank you two be chief seat she acknowledge herself indebt to your eloquence noble Vitellius who in senate late you prove her marriage lawful and be censor depose Silanus from his praetorship who shall have marry young Octavia to you brave Pollio who persuasion have be the cause young Nero now enjoy that happy marriage which Silanus lose but most of all she owe to both your pain in cause Caesar to adopt she Nero it|be hard to work at first Caesar stick at it allege that the claudian family never adopt any and beside when Lucius Geta and Crispinus Rufus in love they bear to young Britannicus tell he that that adoption to the world will be ridiculous by precedent we do refute it show how Tiberius have a son and nephew both alive adopt the issue of Germanicus my lord it|be noble carry this design that now we have in hand though not so hard to work will prove as advantageous be you with Caesar I|will go satisfy the empress of your love farewell my lord go flatter senator go use your best persuasive eloquence while I alone upon your envy rise while I enjoy in Agrippina love the fruit of your obsequious diligence what though my birth be humble and my style but one of Caesar freedman though I boast not patrician blood nor in my gallery display old rank of noseless ancestor or ear-crop image if I enjoy whatever high nobility can give respect and power the state can witness it the senate fear i and in flattery have sue to Caesar to confer on i praetorian and quaestorian ornament which I at last vouchsafe to accept when my command alone have doom to death the noble of that order man who name old Rome have boast of who virtue raise she to that envy height that now she hold their murder stupid Caesar rather choose to take upon himself then question i let dull patrician boast their airy title and count i base while I commend their life and for the furtherance of my high intent make noble man my hate instrument but ha Narcissus yes there come a man that be my rival once who I fear more than all the lord of Rome my fellow free man that know our way of power that not the senate but Caesar chamber do command the world and rule the fate of man but fortune be turn and he not worth my regard or fear in master he I feel my great strength exit not look upon i be I fall so low do I in equal place with this proud man nay far above he sway the state and rule great Caesar heart while Messalina live and be not there content o punishment of my ambitious aim but cause the death of that loose empress to bring in the expulse Aelia Petina and instead of her have let this tigress Agrippina in this dragon spirit to devour we all except proud Pallas her adulterer what unavoided danger every way threaten this life for if young Nero reign I die that seek to cross his mother match if ere Britannicus do reign I die that cause his mother death what shall I do where shall I lean for safety better trust the innocent goodness of Britannicus then Agrippina fierce and cruel nature nor can I hope more goodness from her son that may give long respite to my fear beside it bear the great show of justice and honest service to my royal master since we must fall it be some happiness to fall the honest way if we may call that honesty at all or real virtue to which necessity enforce we and we by fortune not election practise here come two friend of young Britannicus hail Lucius Geta hail Crispinus Rufus brave roman your be come fit to ease my overburden breast of weighty thought which I dare free trust unto your noble ear you may Narcissus trust truth with we you know my lord and I must needs confess I be a mean of Messalina death but all the god can witness with i how unwilling I lend a hand to that sad action and but for Caesar safety which I prize above my life and fortune and which then I think endanger much by her hold act nought in the world can ere have move i to it then know my lord how little I respect my private end to do the public service and can lose myself for Caesar good it may be think when the most hopeful prince Britannicus shall wear that wreath which all the world adore to i it may be fatal as a foe unto his mother but I rather wish myself for ever lose then that brave prince shall not succeed his father how succeed what fear be there of that what power on earth can bar his right while we command the camp I|will rather see which all the god avert Rome rend again with civil broil than he shall lose unjust the imperial throne you|be true and noble friend and here I vow to join with you and use my uttermost power to advance the honour of Britannicus do you not know to who the son of Agrippina marry and that honour be enough for he without adoption too be his aim private and that his crafty mother do not cast a way for he to the succession they make the faction strong and cunning increase the train of Nero and displace the faithful servant of Britannicus wise Seneca recall from banishment by Agrippina mean not for the love she bear his virtue but to make he she that Seneca authority may gain the people love to her ambitious son of who young year he take tuition beside to make the match for her young Nero with Octavia noble Silanus die who may have prove a faithful prop to Claudius family in blood that fatal marriage be begin I fear the omen Agrippina fierce and cruel nature have too much be see in this short time Lollia Paulina niece to Cotta Messalinus and late wife to Caius Caesar for no other cause then aim once at Claudius marriage be banish Italy her good be seize and but five million of sesterce leave she of all her great estate but there the malice of this fell woman stay not now we hear a tribune be dispatch away to kill the banish lady and bring back her head yet more I fear since her Domitius be adopt now I fear she|will short aim at high blood and I|will be vigilant for Caesar safety when all her end be wrought his death be next I|be sure I be his elder son and while I live I think that Caesar have not lack a heir but I at last have find a elder brother Domitius be adopt Caesar son his name be Nero now I can tell what be my fault excellent youth how much beyond his year he apprehend his wrong fear not sweet prince though Agrippina son be two year elder than yourself the senate will never judge that a adopt son shall in succession be prefer before the true and natural heir you ever love i pray do so still while we have breath my lord you shall command our life how unaware have feeble Caesar wrought a snare to catch his own unhappy life in grow sweet prince grow up to strengthen the imperial house and curb the furious malice of thy foe Haile to you Domitius Aenobarbus do you scorn my salutation or not know my name well let they go my lord it|be not the brain of young Britannicus that can give birth to this minurious scorn though for his year the boy be capable but ripe head than his there go his counsel Crispinus Rufus and that Lucius Geta who swell the youth with boast hope and think their power can give protection to his pride I|will make they see their error and perceive one breath of i can blow they from their strength this news I|will bear to Agrippina straight Come prince Britannicus shall find anon what feeble prop his pride have lean upon exeunt nay that must be your office you have read my commentary over and I look for a faithful censure I be sure my lord you have both learning able to discern and such integrity as will not flatter speak Seneca I see they look on you how do you like they royal Agrippina such and so good they be that able man may bold speak and not offend the truth nor you at all the style be full and princely stately and absolute beyond whatever these eye have see and Rome who majesty be there describe in after time shall owe for her memorial to your learned pen more than to all those fade monument build with the riches of the spoil world when rust shall eat her brass when time strong hand shall bruise to dust her marble palace triumphal arch pillar obelisk when Julius temple Claudius aqueduct Agrippa bath and Pompey theater nay Rome itself shall not be find at all historian book shall live those strong record those deathless monument alone shall show what and how great the roman empire be the act be noble not the present world alone shall owe to Agrippina worth as for her gracious government it do but future age shall acknowledge more to the rich labour of her royal pen the wise prince never seek to raise their present state alone but to preserve themselves immortal by a endless fame for memory of i beside these book if that our augur fail not in their skill or flatter not that German colony which I of late deduct over the Rhine to ubium for evermore the name of Agrippina colony shall bear that act though great declare your power alone your wealth and greatness but these learned book express your wisdom and for these you owe nothing at all to fortune thus I mean to spend all time which from affair of state and business of our empire can be spare those wretch have too narrow soul who think that person great and eminent in state can spare no time to purchase same by writing but what they steal from action and employment as if no mind be large enough for both who be more full of action and more fit to rule nay rule the world than Julius Caesar yet he be of my mind o strange male spirit can there be find no other parallel but Julius Caesar to a woman mind yet Julius be too blame he toil too much to get his honour and too much debar his nature the free use of princely pleasure sure Lucius Sylla have a ample mind it|be Sulla character that Sallust give he a free and great enjoyer of his pleasure yet how industrious his action speak he find fit time to rule the roman world and write both greek and latin commentary the soul of Sylla and of Caesar both I think have enter she well worthy friend you do approve my way of write then yes gracious madam and because you name great Julius to we I be think now that as in blood so in your style of write there be some nearness Seneca I thank you but I confess your positive approbation please i as well as that comparison indifferent well a good loose careless way I think direct with Asinius Pollio have Caesar live he will have mend it the man have far more in he then that show yet under favour madam some have think those commentary hardly can be mend a style so strong naked and beautiful free from affect word and from all gloss or dress of oratory as in stead of lead other in a way to write it quite discourage the able man so Hirtius think and that fame Cicero the great master of Rome eloquence be those your author then that Hirtius be Caesar servant partial in his heart or else he flatter he for Cicero they be so far out of his tedious strain he can not censure they yet able man can true censure of another style then what themselves have use he be not able no not in oratory have I rule Rome and her senate then as now I do not all the oration that ever Cicero make in the senate shall have save one hair of a offendor or condemn a mouse I be amaze but let she have her way forgive my silence noble Cicero here thy defence be vain but what I spare the tongue of all posterity shall speak the tribune madam be return and bring Lollia Paulina head let i peruse this face ha it|be much change her tooth shall make i sure they do not grow Dio. the common way I be confirm it|be she reward he Pallas the god preserve Augusta Agrippina o pale death thou mock of beauty and of greatness too be this the face that once in Caesar love be Agrippina rival and dare hope as much against i as my unquestioned power have wrought on she be this that beauty once that wear the riches of the world about it for who attire all land all sea be search all creature robe This this be that Paulina who Cajus Caesar serve who Rome adore and the world fear such a sight methinks shall make she sad think of humane frailty take hence the head lest in her death she gain a great conquest over i than her life can ever do to make i shed a tear I will not wrong the justice I have do so much as to lament it now you know my friend she have a spirit dangerous and though my nature can have pardon she reason of state forbid it which then tell i great ruin have be wrought by foolish pity will she have such a nature but it|be now too late to give her counsel so let all that dare contest with Agrippina fall enter servant now friend Vitellius Pollio Pallas second i wondrous well when I be bless with Caesar company that shall be oft my love when Rome affair and public business will give i leave I will partake myself of those affair rather than want your presence thou shall it|be only for thy dear sake I love my fortune thy sweet fellowship make light the burden of my government to ease great Caesar care shall ever be the height of my desire before you come my heart be sad I send for these my friend to impart the reason to they weigh the trouble of a princely state and all the danger that still threaten it Shee strike upon the fit string no passion reign in he so much as fear we be devise of the fit mean to give your state security you know your strong guard be the praetorian camp that camp command now by two may be by captain too ambitious strife divide into faction and so make less serviceable shall your safety need they Caesar remember when that bold attempt of Silius be how the praetorian camp be by their general strife in mutiny and have not one be choose for that day to rule they all Caesar have not be safe wise man in calm provide for storm to come none know how dangerous the time may prove though now the state be safe and may the god to Caesar honour long preserve it so what new design be this that all of they aside second so ready and I be not acquaint with it if|it prove mischievous I thank the empress for my ignorance Burrhus Afranius be a worthy man fit for the place and faithful well-beloved by all the soldier such a change my lord none can except against let he take all whatever her end may be this proposition for noble Burrhus sake I must approve it|be true my love I make no question of Burrhus worth and fitness for the place but what offence have Geta and Crispinus be ever accuse of or what just suspicion be there of they I will not be unjust to accuse guiltless man although I price thy safety Caesar equal to my life I know no crime of note they have commit Caesar it be no loss to they at all they both have plenteous fortune to retire to and in so near a cause who dare examine great Caesar counsel or inquire the reason shall Burrhus have it Caesar speak thy pleasure or if my care offend I shall hereafter forbear to meddle no sweet Agrippina since thou will have it so go Pallas draw the warrant straight and seal it in our name let Geta and Crispinus be remove and Burrhus take possession present this day my love the Britain prisoner send from Ostorius Scapula and late arrive at Rome shall be in public show there thou shall see that brave barbarian prince that bold Caractacus who stubborn spirit so many year contemn the roman power he now be take it|be a victory send from the god to honour Claudius reign have he be base take or at first yield himself as he have get no honour but be forget in his fall and nought have ever be mention of he but his death so have thy glory Caesar be far less not warlike Syphax the numidian king stubborn Jugurtha nor great Perseus ere bring to Rome by their captivity more real honour then this Britain prince nor do we price our name Britannicus fetch from that island less than Scipio his honour name of Africanus prize thy style oh Caesar be the great far draw from the conquest of another world which nature mean by interpose cold and stormy sea to guard from latian arm great Julius Caesar do but only show that land to we who conquest be reserve by heaven decree to honour Claudius name Caesar let|we sit together one tribunal will hold we both it shall be so my love thou as myself shall pardon or condemn who shall it be farewell brave Pallas exeunt Vitel. and Pol. Narcissus hail or any honest secret what be|it you will with we what hence will you infer what danger threaten it yes it|be strange do of Caesar I confess I think no less o barbarous cruelty we|will guard the life of young Britannicus here come the youthful hope of Rome and we tell i my friend be not I Caesar son my lord who dare to question it brother Britannicus hail that be your father name and why not you how|be that proud boy exeunt Brit. and reliq you be my judge your poor servant madam be she already turn our emperor do not your majesty esteem his book how confident she be in censure let he come in your pleasure great Augusta be perform Caesar be come to visit you how fare my Agrippina I believe it sad for what danger most true
