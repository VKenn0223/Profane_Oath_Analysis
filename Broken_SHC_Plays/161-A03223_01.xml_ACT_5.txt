Come come spread spread up with the pulpit straight seat for the judge all the king of Greece why when you lazy drudge be this place for a whole jury royal where|be the armour the prize for which the crafty fox Ulysses and mad bull Aiax must this day contend what be all ready rare world when instead of smooth tongue lawyer soldier now must plead this session valiant duke of Salamine and king of Ithaca be call for you since great Achilles armour be the prize due to the worthy here before these king and in the face of all the multitude you be appoint for your several plea that prince who to these arm can prove most right shall wear his purchase in the army sight if to the worthy they belong to i can you select amongst all this throng of prince none worthy than Ulysses to contend with Aiax and in view of all our navy of all these tall ship gild with Hector flame which when Ulysses flee into his tent ay I extinguish these twelve hundred ship I save at once deserve Achilles arm Laertes son may think it grace enough that though he miss his aim he may be say to have strive with Aiax Aiax who excel as much in arm as he in eloquence my hand perform more than his tongue can speak act more than he can talk be I less valiant and have but half my vigour like he weak my royal birth will for this armour speak duke Telamonius that in the Argo sail to Colchos and in Ilium second sack first rear Alcides colour on the wall my father be his father Aeacus on of the three that judge infernal soul and Aeacus be son to jupiter thus be I three from jove beside Achilles by marriage be my brother and I crave since he be dead my brother arm to have what have Ulysses with our kin to do be a stranger not of Peleus blood grave hero if not honour prize my merit I plead both worth and blood these arm to inherit believe i two sound plea on Aiax part I fear the prize will be confer on he his argument be maxim and sound proof to win he way into the soldier heart let he proceed because I haste to the siege of Troy when he feign madness must he wear these arm when in the phalanx with old Nestor charge thou at the name of Hector flee the field and leave the good old man encompass round call aloud Ulysses Ulysses stay the more he cry the more thou make thy way prince Diomedes you see it and upbraid this ithacan base flight but see heaven justice old Nestor escape great Hector be not there but meet Ulysses as he flee from Hector he that but late deny help now want help for at the sight of Hector down he fall and cry aloud for aid I come and see thou quake with terror under Hector arm the ponderous blow I take upon my targe and as the least of all my noble deed save these faint limb from slaughter which now sue to don these glorious arm nor do I blame thou for fear Hector what be he of Greece that save Aiax quake not at his name yet do I meet that Hector guile in blood of grecian prince fight with he so long till all the host deaf with our horrid stroke begird we with amazement will thou know my honour in this combat it be this I be not conquer if thou still contend imagine but that field the time the foe Hector alive thou quake at his foot and Aiax interpose his broad shield betwixt death and thou and thou the arm must yield what can the wise Ulysses say to this Aiax prevail much with the multitude the general murmur do accord with he I ever think the son of Telamonius do better merit the achillean arm then the dulichian king forbear to censure till both be full hear methinks grave hero you shall seek a Aiax to wear these arm not let these arm be seek by Aiax what have sly Ulysses do to countervail my act kill unarm Rhesus and set on sleepy Dolon in the night steal the Palladium from the trojan fane o brave exploit nor have thou these perform without the help of warlike Diomedes so you betwixt you shall divide these spoil Alas thou know not what thou seek fond man thou that fight all by craft and in the night the radiant splendour of this burnish helm shine in darkness as the sun by day thy thievish spoil and ambush will betray thy politic head|be too weak to bear this cask this massy helm thou can not mount his spear his warlike shield that bear the world engrave will tire thy arm fool thou do ask a spear a shield a cask thou have not strength to wear now if these king or the vain people error so far shall err from truth to give they thou it|will be a means to make thou soon die the weight will lag thou that be wont to fly thou have a shield unscare my sevenfold targe with thousand gash piecemeal from my arm and none but that will fit i to conclude go bear these arm for which we two contend into the mid-rank of our enemy and bid we fetch they thence and he to wear they by who this royal armour can be win I have rather fight than talk so I have do if with your prayer o grecian king my vow may have prevail with heaven there have be then no such contention thou have keep thy arm and we Achilles thou but since the fate have take he from we who have now more right to claim these arm he dead than he that give they unto Achilles live nor great prince let that smooth eloquence yond fellow scorn if it be any be reject now and hurt his master which so many time have profit whole Greece if we plead blood which be not we but all our ancestor Laertes be my father his Arcesius his jove from who I be three beside I claim a second godhead by my mother name what do we talk of birth if birth shall bear they his father be near jove than he shall wear this honour or if next of blood Achilles father Peleus shall enjoy they or his son Pyrrhus but we plead not kindred or near propinquity let alliance rest his be the armour that deserve it best Achilles mother Thetis be foretell her son shall die at Troy conceal he from we in habit of a lady to this siege I bring he therefore challenge all his deed as by Ulysses do it|be I sack Thebes Chriscis and Scylla with Lernessus wall I Troilus and renown Hector slay first with this helmet I adorn his head he give it live who demand it dead it|be true for like a pedlar be disguise and come where Achilles spend his youth in womanish habit the young lady they look on his glass jewel and fine toy he have a bow too much Achilles draw so by his strength the ithacan he know have Aiax go Achilles then have stay Hector still live our ransack tent to invade what can thou do but bare fight no more I can both fight and counsel I direct the manner of our battle and propose for victual and munition to supply the universal host cheer up the soldier to endure a tedious siege when all the army cry let|we away for Greece and raise their tent Aiax among the foremost have trust up his bag and baggage when I rate he and they and all and by my oratory persuade their retreat what Greece have win from Troy since then be by Ulysses do behold my wound o grecian and judge you if they be coward mark they|be in my breast let boast Aiax show such noble scar these grecian hero take I in your war I grant he fight with Hector it|be well do where thou deserve well I will give thou due but what be the success of that great day Hector of Troy unwounded go away now sure the prize will to Ulysses fall the murmur soldier mutter his desert prefer he fore Aiax hear the rest but o Achilles when I view these arm I can but lament thy obsequy thou wall of Greece when thou be base slay I take thou on my soldier and from Troy bear thou then arm in the habiliment I once more seek to bear behold that shield it|be a description cosmographical of all the earth the air the sea and heaven

night I venture through Troy gate and from the temple rape the Palladium than I conquer Troy Troy while that stand can never be subdue in that I bring away their god their honour Troy ruin and the triumph of whole Greece what have blunt Aiax do to countervail this one of i he do with Hector fight I ten year war have end in one night what Aiax do be but by my direction my counsel fight in he and
