these troop and company come in with wing so many man so arm so gallant horse I think no other government in France so soon can bring together with such man methinks a man may pass the|insult pillar of Bacchus and Alcides I much wonder our lord lieutenant bring his brother down to feast and honour he and yet now leave he at such a instance it|be the king command for who he must leave brother wife friend all thing the confine of his government who view be the pretext of his command have need of no such sudden expedition we must not argue that the king command be need and right enough and that he serve as all true subject shall without dispute but know not he of your command to take his brother Clermont no the king will be express to conceal his apprehension from my lord governor observe you not again peruse the letter both you be make my assistant and have right and trust in all the weighty secret like myself it|be strange a man that have through his life past so sure a foot in virtue and true knowledge as Clermont D'Ambois shall be now find trip and take up thus so to make his fall more steep and headlong it be virtue fortune to keep her low and in her proper place height have no room for she but as a man that have a fruitful wife and every year a child by she have every year a month to breathe himself where he that get no child have not a night rest if he will do well So let one marry this same barren virtue she never let he rest where fruitful vice spare her rich drudge give he in labour breath feed he with bane and make he fat with death I see that good life never can secure man from bad liver worst man will have best as ill as they or heaven to hell they|will wrest there be a merit for this in the fault that Bussy make for which he do penance prove that these foul adulterous guilt will run through the whole blood which not the clear can shun I|will therefore take heed of the bastard whole innocent race it|be a fearful thing and as I be true bachelor I swear to touch no woman to the couple end unless it be i own wife or my friend I may make bold with he it|be safe and common the more your friend dare trust the more deceive he and as through dewy vapour the sun form make the gay rainbow girdle to a storm so in heart hollow friendship even the sun to all good grow in society make he so glorious and divine name hold colour for all the ill that can be tell hark our last troop be come hark our last foot Come let we put all quick into battle and send for Clermont in who honour all this martial preparation we pretend we must bethink we ere we apprehend he beside our main strength of some stratagem to make good our severe command on he as well to save blood as to make he sure for if he come on his scotch horse all France put at the heel of he will fail to take he what think you if we shall disguise a brace of our best soldier in fair lackey coat and send they for he run by his side till they have bring he in some ambuscado we close may lodge for he and sudden lay sure hand on he pluck he from horse it must be sure and strong hand for if once he feel the touch of such a stratagem it|be not the choice brace of all our band can manacle or quench his fiery hand when they have seize he the ambush shall make in do as you please his blameless spirit deserve I dare engage my life of all this nothing why shall all this stir be then who know not the bombast polity thrust into his giant to make his wisdom seem of size as huge and all for sleight encounter of a shade so he be touch he will have heinous make it may be once so but so ever never ambition be abroad on foot on horse faction choke every corner street the court who faction it|be you know and who be hold the fautor right hand how high his aim reach nought but a crown
