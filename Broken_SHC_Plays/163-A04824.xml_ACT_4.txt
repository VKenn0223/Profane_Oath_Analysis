a kingdom get by blood be build upon a slippery foundation I have be nourish in peace thus long that be grow specious and great I may at last fall down a sacrifice worth slaughter thought urge thought suspicion get suspicion danger danger I have not that small settledness of mind as to think one thing twice be I but innocent I will provoke misfortune call for fate with as undaunted courage as the lord and ruler of it do what a nothing it|be that I have thus much fear and labour to escape when it|be my good childish dread every thought of cure then most offend when my health be near how well I|be after this little wound quiet of mind and peace of conscience those bless companion do possess i now I see nothing but blood can appease blood in sacrifice that to the guilty there|be no ease like death no mercy like the cross o o the king make sign of weakness and the guard make a offer to kill Pallantus hold in your rage have you not already act mischief enough by my command but thus you seek to pull more upon you you be deceive though I have be hitherto a tyrant now I be merciful and can command thing that be just and innocent I command you hold my power be yet good you be the

be this place the grave where death inhabit be not so dreadful I|will fly thou though I run among the thick of my foe they can present no danger like this loneness the cry the sword the trumpet in the battle strike not so deep amazement what ho Clitus Charisius Erastus Amanthes not one voice I walk like Aeneas among the shade all be hell about i I see nothing but what my fantasy frame in horrid shape oh the vain fear of guilty man all be unreasonable but you ridiculous when you have contemn the great power on earth threaten with strength and hatred you tremble at a ghost a thing less than be

Theseus but mar eternity they breathe from one but gain heaven by the other these be the great thought which when I be yet young and not able to embrace they do dwell in i they do suggest unto my soul that I ought to raise my hand against the god if they sleep at perjury and favour injustice o my soul|be more earthly than my body this war that be within i will gain a victory over i I find decay already fortune glory victory all be flee unto their several habitation and have leave dishonour loss danger in their stead not so much praise to all our dead story as that we lose one man to save a

bring we happiness and glory I be for the last it be the safe way and in our grief the noble sir these fellow come to kill we one of the weak on they when he see himself lay hold on for his other fault suspect he be discover out of mere guiltiness confess that unwilling he be bring into the plot by the persuasion of his fellow who in hope of preferment from the enemy have decree on all our death he say too that himself and many more be attempt by some of the adverse party with promise and threat to lay down their arm and that the camp be full of such commotor This then will confirm our former resolution come let we number up ourselves and if we be equal each man set his sword against his fellow breast and with a friendly wound in spite of fate or fortune be ourselves lord of a great power give happiness to either then these wild beast will deplore the loss of that they so endeavour to throw away and leap like headless body into flame and ruin o my lord let we embrace you with

Phronimus be already go with his force to stop the passage between the enemy and the city we in front will stand against they so that in the morning when they rise it shall appear to they as if they be inhabit with foe not be able to turn away they shall not lose their sight in our large number some of those which be send to corrupt the enemy be return and say their word be hearken to beyond their expectation and if a present assault be give there be no doubt of victory all be in such a tumult such evil increase by delay we|will let they grow until the morning and then our sight will gain the conquest if it be possible we|will order|it so that we may rather show they war than bring it on they though they be give into our hand we ought not to show our mercy and not our power o o madam
