pass his word yet it|be my wonder that Florentio a soldier so exact practise in all the mystery of war and peace shall trust himself where the enemy faith must best secure he the great Decastro sir who our late king depute regent at his death and who the kingdom judge fit to marry with his only heir the present queen though she disdain his love and our desire have prove to time and fortune that he fear no danger but what may wound his honour how can then Florentio though he now set down before our city with so vast a army choose a place for interview by art and nature so fortify as where decastro faith make it impregnable distrust my lord be the best counselor to great design our confidence betray we but between these two be other seed of jealousy such as will almost force religion break her tie vow authorize perjury and make the scrupulous casuist say that faith be the fool virtue they both love the queen Decastro build on his high desert and vote of Arragon Florentio on the favour he gain from her majesty when here he live employ by his great master king of Castille such politic respect may warrant the bad statesman to dark action but both these general by a noble war resolve to try their fate but here my lord enter Sanmartino be a full period to all serious thought this lord be so impertinent yet still upon the whisper he|be a mischief sir no court be safe from what fine trick he show each morning on his jennet but to gain a female vision from some half-opened window and if a lady smile by accident or but in scorn of he yet he kind soul interpret it as prophesy to some near favour to ensue at night I wonder what make he thought a wit a copper wit which fool let pass for currant so false coin such very alchemy that who vent he for aught but parcel ass may be in danger look on he and in little there see draw the picture of the youth be so admire of the spruce sir who lady and their woman call the fine gentleman what be those paper with such a sober brow he look upon nor platform nor intelligence but a prologue he come to whisper to one of the maid in|the privy chamber after supper I praise the courage of his folly yet who fear can make wise my good lord brave oniate see you not the general he|be upon entrance here and how my lord I see your lordship turn over paper what|be the discovery it may import decastro knowledge never better language or neat wit a paper of such verse write by the exact hand in time of business as serious as our safety to intrude the dream of madman my judicious lord it with the favour of your lordship may concern the general such high rapture in admiration of the queen who he pretend to love how will her majesty smile on his suit when in the heat of business he not neglect this amorous way to woe she no man presume to|advance a foot my lord Ossuna I desire your ear my lord I have a piece here of such elegant wit your pardon good my lord we le find a hour less serious to advise upon your paper and then at large we|will whisper as you please my lord you|will pardon the error of my duty the queen my lord give free access to what I speak of|the public but when I begin to mention love how do she frown or with what murder scorn hear she Decastro name love of thy labyrinth of art what path leave I untrodden humble I have labour to win her favour and when that prevail not the kingdom in my quarrel vow to empty the vein of their great body sir she heart be mighty than misfortune though her youth soft as some consecrate virgin wax seem easy for impression yet her virtue hard as a rock of diamond break all the battery of the wave she charge i tell you that a faith less moor who have gain honour only by the ruin of what we hold religious soon she will welcome to her bed than who to his queen and love have be a rebel how a rebel the people suffrage which inaugurate prince have warrant my action but she answer the subtle art of faction not free vote command her restraint May even those star who influence make i great turn their aspect to blood and ruin if ambition raise the appetite of love her beauty have a power more sovereign than the eastern slave acknowledge ever in his idol king to that I bow a subject but when I discover that her fancy fix upon Florentio general now of the enemy army I let the people use their severe way and they restrain she but my lord their guilt be make your crime yet all this new affliction disturb she not to anger but disdain she have a glorious spirit yet the world the envious world itself must justify that howsoever fortune yield up the sceptre to my power I do but kiss it and offer it again into her hand he|be safe welcome now let each man keep at a due distance I have here attend your lordship presence o my lord be we who love oblige to the same allegiance bring hither on these term the be term of honour and I yet never know to frame excuse where that beget the quarrel yet methinks we may have find another way to it we may have seek out danger where the proud insult moor profane our holy place the noise of war have be no trouble then but now too much it|will fright the gentle ear of her we both be vow to serve that love which arm we both bear witness that I have much rather have encounter lightning than create the least distraction to her peace but since the vote of Arragon decree that my long service have the just claim to challenge her regard thus I must stand arm to make good the title this vain language scarce move my pity what desert can rise so high to merit she be each short moment of|the long live commander lengthen to a age and that expose to danger mighty as coward frame they can you think his service may challenge her regard like the heavenly bounty she may distribute favour but it|be sin to say our merit may pretend a title but my lord you|will find a soldier in this arm which strengthen by such a cause may level mountain high as those the giant emblem of your thought pile up to have scale heaven that must be decide by the sword and if my lord our interview have no more sober end than a dispute so froward let we make the trumpet drown the noise you shall not want that music but before we yield up our reason unto fury I desire we may expostulate the ground of this so fatal war and bring you to that low obedience nature place you in my ear attend you where be then that humble zeal you owe a mistress if you can throw off that duty which you owe she as your queen what justice that fair rule of humane action can you pretend for take arm I|will not deny for from a enemy I|will not detract during her nonage when the public choice and her great father will enthrone you in the government you manage affair with prudence equal to the fame you gain and when your sword do fight her quarrel it|be crown with victory but hence ambition and ingratitude draw only venom for by these great action you labour not to advance her state or honour but subtle wrought upon the people love a love beget by error follow still apparency not truth the sun be not more visible when not one cloud wrinkle the brow of heaven for on that false strength you have in|the multitude you swell to insolence dare court your queen boast your merit like some wanton tyrant in|the vanity of a new conquest and when you perceive her judgement do instruct she to frown on the attempt profane against all law of love and majesty you make the people in your quarrel seize upon the sacred person of the fair queen story ere boast not yet this injury provoke my master to raise these mighty force for her rescue and name i general who aim be not a vain ambition but to advance her service ere we begin to punish take this offer restore the queen to liberty with each due circumstance that such a majesty may challenge free to make choice of who she shall advance to the honour of her bed if your desert bear that high rate you mention why shall you doubt your fortune on these term the king king of Castille may be induce to pardon the error of your ruin thus in short my answer how unlimited soever my power have be my reason and my love have circumscribe it true the queen stand now restrain but it|be by the decree of the whole kingdom lest her error shall persuade she to some man less worthy less worthy than myself for so they judge the proud subject to a foreign prince but when you mention love where be your blush what can you answer for the practise the queen affection when ambassador you lay here from Castille pretend only affair import both the kingdom nor can you my lord be tax by your discretion that by the humble art of love you labour to win so bright a beauty and a queen so potent your affection look not here without a eye upon your profit no protestation if you will withdraw your force from our kingdom and permit they to our law and government that peace which have continue many age sacred stand firm between we but if not pray stay my lord do not your lordship see the advantage I have in the place with how much ease I may secure my fortune from the great danger of your force ha it|be inconsiderate in i but I trust to the honour of your word which you|will
