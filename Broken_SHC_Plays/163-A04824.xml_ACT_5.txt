name be due to i when you be please to call yourself a enemy if you be one it be to yourself in thus prefer your mercy before your safety you have give my brother life to bring your own in danger and remove my grief which hereafter may be the cause of it to yourself sir think i unworthy but not a scorner of these favour be my sorrow heaver thus offer it|be but religion to bow and to receive they
