do Erisychthon offer force to my nymph and to my deity disgrace have I stuff his barn with fruitful grain and do he stretch his hand against i with intolerable pride so it be Ceres thy eye may witness what thy nymph have tell here lie the tree hack in piece and the blood scarce cold of the fair virgin if this be thy cruelty Cupid I will no more hallow thy temple with sacred vow if thy canker nature Erisychthon thou shall find as great misery as thou show malice I be resolve of thy punishment and as speedy shall be my revenge as thy rigour barbarous tirtenae on yonder lull where never grow grain nor lease where nothing be but barrenness and coldness fear and paleness lie famine go to she and say that Ceres command she to gnaw on the bowel of Erisychthon that his hunger may be as unquenchable as his fury I obey but how shall I know she from other thou can not miss of she if thou remember but her name and that can thou not forget for that come near to the place thou shall find gnaw in thy stomach Shee lie gape and swallow enough but air her face pale and so lean that as easy thou may through the very skin behold the bone as in a glass thy shadow her hair long black and shaggy her eye sink so far into her head that she look out of the nape of her neck her lip white and rough her tooth hollow and red with rustiness her skin so thin that thou may as lively make a anatomy of her body as she be cut up with chirurgeon her maw like a dry bladder her heart swell big with wind and all her bowel like snake work in her body this monster when thou shall behold tell she my mind and return with speed I go fear more the sight of famine than the force take thou these few care of corn but let not famine so much as smell to they and let she go aloof from thou now shall Erisychthon see that Ceres be a great goddess as full of power as himself of pride and as pitiless as he presumptuous how think you lady be not this revenge apt for so great injury yes madam to let man see they that contend with the god do but confound themselves but let we to the temple of Cupid and offer sacrifice they that think it strange for chastity to humble itself to Cupid know neither the power of love nor the nature of virginity the|one have absolute authority to command the other difficulty to resist and where such continual war be between love and virtue there must be some party and continual peril Cupid be never conquer and therefore must be flatter virginity have and therefore must be humble into my heart madam there do never enter any motion of love those that often say they can love or will not love certain they love do thou never see Cupid no but I have hear he describe at the full and as I imagine foolish first that he shall be a god blind and naked with wing with bow with arrow with free-brand swim sometime in the sea and play sometime on the shore with many other device which the painter be the poet ape have take as great pain to shadow as they to lie can I think that god that command all thing will go naked what shall he do with wing that know not where to slice or what with arrow that see not how to aim the heart be a narrow mark go hit and rather require Argus eye to take level there a blind boy to shoot at random if he be fire the sea will quench those coal or the flame turn he into cinder well Nisa thou shall see he I fear Niobe have feel he not I madam yet must I confess that oftentimes I have have sweet thought sometime hard conceit betwixt both a kind of yield I know not what but certain I think it be not love sigh I can and find ease in melancholy smile I do and take pleasure in imagination I feel in myself a please pain a chill heat a delicate bitterness how to term it I know not without doubt it may be love sure I be it be not hate Niobe be tender heart who thought be like water yield to every thing and nothing to be see well let we to Cupid and take heed that in your stubborness you|will offend he not who by entreaty you ought to follow Diana nymph be as chaste as Ceres virgin as fair as wife how Cupid torment they I have rather you shall hear then feel but this be truth they all yield to love look not scornful my nymph I say they be yield to love this be the temple thou great god Cupid who the god regard and man reverence let it be lawful for Ceres to offer her sacrifice divine Ceres Cupid accept any thing that come from Ceres which feed my sparrow with ripe corn my pigeon with wholesome seed and honour my temple with chaste virgin then love to thou I bring these white and spotless dove in token that my heart be as free from any thought of love as these from any blemish and as clear in virginity as these perfect in whiteness but that my nymph may know both thy power and thy law and neither err in ignorance nor pride let i ask some question to instruct they that they offend not those who resist they can in virgin what do thou chief desire in those that be not in love reverent thought of love in those that be faithful vow what do thou most hate in virgin pride in the beautiful bitter taunt in the witty incredulity in all what may protect my virgin that they may never love that they be never idle why do thou so cruel torment all Diana nymph with love because they think it impossible to love what be the substance of love constancy and secrecy what the sign sigh and tear what the cause wit and idleness what the mean opportunity and importunity what the end happiness without end what require thou of man that only shall be know to man what revenge for those that will not love to be deceive when they do well Cupid entreat my nymph with favour and though to love it be no vice yet spotless virginity be the only virtue let i keep their thought as chaste as their body than Ceres may be happy and they praise why Ceres do you think that lust follow love Ceres lover be chaste for what be love divine love but the quintessence of chastity and affection bind by heavenly motion thou can be undo by earthly mean 〈…〉 by any man 〈…〉 continual sacrifice warm we with mild 〈…〉 we seem immodest 〈…〉 ●ble like stock Ceres 〈…〉 be light nor obstinacy 〈…〉 and faithful so shall your flame warm but not burn delight and never discomfort How say you my nymph do not Cupid speak like a god counsel you I will not to love but conjure you I must that you be not disdainful let we in and see how Erisicthon speed famine fly swift and have already seize on his stomach
