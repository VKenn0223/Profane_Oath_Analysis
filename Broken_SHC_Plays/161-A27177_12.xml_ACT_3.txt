he esteem monster nay the ill-judging world be likely enough to give they those character what|be this to love and to love and to the lady he|be old wrathful perverse self-willed and full of anger which be his fault but let they not be thou he thrust you from his love she pull thou on he doubt your virtue she do double they oh either use thy own eye or take i and with they my heart than thou will love she nay dote upon she more than on thy duty and man will praise thou equal for it neglect she condemn thou as a man unworthy such a fortune oh Antinous it|be not the friendship that I bear to thou but her command that make i utter this and when I have prevail let she but say Philander you must die or this be nothing it shall be do together with a breath with the same willingness I live to serve she no more Philander all I have do be little yet to purpose but ere I leave he I will perceive he blush and make he feel the passion that I do and every true lover will assist i in|it and lend i their sad sigh to blow it home for Cupid want a dart to wound this bosom no more no more Philander I can endure no more pray let he go go good Antinous make peace with your own mind no matter though I perish Ex.
