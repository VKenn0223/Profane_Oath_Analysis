with what base wrong I be unwilling draw to it to my few word there be some other proof to witness this for truth when I be marry for there I must begin the slay Novall be to my wife in way of our french courtship a most devote servant but yet aim at nothing but mean to quench his wanton heat his heart be never warm by lawful fire as i be lord and though on these presumption join to the hate between his house and i I may with opportunity and ease have find a way for my revenge I do not but still he have the freedom as before when all be i and tell that he abuse it with some unseemly licence by my friend my approve friend Romont I give no credit to the reporter but reprove he for it as one uncourtly and malicious to he what can I more my lord yet after this he do continue in his first pursuit hot than ever and at length obtain it but how it come to my most certain knowledge for the dignity of the court and my own honour I dare not say if all may be believe a passionate prisoner speak who be so foolish that dare be wicked that will appear guilty no my grave lord in his impunity but give example unto jealous man to cut the throat they hate and they will never want
