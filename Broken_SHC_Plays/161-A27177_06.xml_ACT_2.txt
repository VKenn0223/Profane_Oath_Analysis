not have war I be a soldier which be my whole inheritance yet I though I can wish a breach with all the world if not dishonourable I be not so malicious to curse the fair peace of my mother country but thou want money and the first supply will bury these thought in thou pox a peace it fill the kingdom full of holiday and only feed the want of whore and piper and make the idle drunken rogue get spinster it|be true I may want money and no little and almost clothes too of which if I have both in full abundance yet against all peace that bring up mischief thick than a shower I will speak loud than a lawyer by heaven it be the surfeit of all youth that make the toughness and the strength of nation melt into woman it|be a ease that brood thief and bastard only this be more though it be true then we ought to lay open and season only of a indiscretion believe i captain such distemper spirit once out of motion though they be proof valiant if they appear thus violent and fiery breed but their own disgrace and be near doubt and suspect in prince than reward it|be well they can be near they any way but call you those true spirit ill affect that while the war be serve like wall and rib

where I have march and travel profit i unless it be for lady to abuse and say it|be spoil for want of a Bongrace when I be young and now it|will make a true prognostication of what man must be tell i of a fellow that can mend nose and complain so tall a soldier shall want tooth to his stomach and how it be great pity that it be that he that make my body be so busy he can not stay to make my leg too but be drive to clap a pair of cat-skin to my knee for which I be indebt to two schoolboy this must follow necessary there|be no such matter then for my moral and those hide piece that art bestow upon i they be such that when they come to light I be sure will shame i for I can neither write nor read nor speak that any man shall hope to profit by i and for my language they be so many that put they altogether they will scarce serve to beg single beer in the plain truth be I love a soldier and can lead he on and if he fight well I dare make he drink this be my virtue and if this will do I|will scramble yet among they it|be your way to be thus pleasant still but fear not man for though the war fail we shall screw ourselves into some course of life yet good Fabritio have a quick eye

half Christendom I be never so ashamed of service in all my life before now I consider what I have do and yet the rogue will swear I be a valiant fellow I do find the great danger I have bring my life through now I have hear this worthy be no more than steal of a maypole or at worst fight at single billet with a bargeman I do believe he Jacamo believe he I have no faith within i if I do not I see
