content to believe because I be unwilling like a faint heart soldier to look of my own wound until I see thou daily wound my love anew and slay thy one reputation be mad no but a little jealous like you I will no long maintain thy sanguine sin sooth lust with patience nor in break sing language flatter thy folly as sweet heart do not wander for I do love thou dear as do a goose her gander a goose indeed for if aught but a goose I shall a seek revenge for wrong what be drink no for I have sufficient reason too much knowledge and sense enough to feel my wrong why shall we woman be slave to your imperfection have we not soul of one mettle be we not as free bear as you be we not all Adam offspring do not you fall as well with he as we and shall we be still keep down and you rise do hear you be a sort of uncertain giddy waver totter tumble creature your affection be like yourselves and yourselves like your affection up and down like the tuck on your petticoat which you let fall and take up as occasion serve I have see of your sex fall in love with a man for wear a handsome rose on his shoe another fall into the passion of the heart to see a man untie his point to make water a three fall into the shake ague for eat a body cherry with two stone and yet you|will be fellow even with the very image of your maker but will let i alone and i'faith I|will be quiet alone faith not then I|will leave thou since I know it|be folly beyond madness to make her pleasure cause of my sadness believe it lady this be well do and like a lady of a high birth make your husband know his advancement o shadow shadow I will have you know I will not wrong he for all the sea drown riches for if my heart of blood shall do it as he suppose it do even that blood will like a traitor write my fault with blush red upon my cheek but because I as all woman and courtier do love good clothes which his eye wear yet he upbraid i swear it|be to please the multitude and that I spread gay rag about i like a net to catch the heart of stranger if I go poor than he swear I be beastly with a loathe sluttishness if I be sad than I grieve he be so near if merry and with a modest wantonise kiss embrace his love then be my twist more dangerous than a snake my lust more unsatiate than be Messalina yet this from jealousy do always grow what most they seek they loth of all will know but now to you dear cousin forgiveness let i ask and pardon for my feign jealousy and take but thus much of my counsel marry not in haste for she that take the best of husband put but on a golden fetter for husband be but like to paint fruit which promise much but still deceive we when we come to touch if you match with a courtier he|will have a dozen mistress at least and repent his marriage within four and twenty hour at most swear a wife be fit for none but a old justice or a country gentleman if you marry a citizen though you live never so honest yet you shall be sure to have a cuckold to your husband if a lawyer the neatness of his clerk will draw in question the good carriage of his wife if a merchant he|will be venture abroad when he may deal a great deal more safe at home therefore come cousin come let|we home and this take of i that among the best there|be none good all ill she|be marry best that|be wed to her will they say Cupid be a boy yet I have know he confute the opinion of all your phylospher for they hold every light thing tend direct up but I think all know he make every light wench fall direct down well I be sure he have knock i with his bird bolt for the which Venus give he correction for I do already love a lady of a imcomparable delicacy but she|be another man and will shut her ear as close to keep out charm as great man do their gate to keep in alm yet I have no reason to despair for I have kiss she and the french proverb say fame baissee est demie ioyee a woman kiss be half enjoy but I fear he mean but the upper half I have here a letter must work a strange thing and yet no miracle it must make a Lady love her friend better than her own husband save you my lord o wage what tennis-ball have fortune take thou for to toss thou thus into my way I hope you will not strike i into any hazard of my life though but what|be the news my lad what|be the news how do sir Timothy troublesome that jealous knight thy master why sir he do with his wife like a cowardly captain in a town of garrison fear every assault tremble at the battery and doubt most least the gate shall be open and his enemy let in at midnight now in the name of destiny who fear he o sir next to you self none so much as your courtier for even with venom breath he speak of they for say he have but a suit to one of they and they be like jordan which though you open the floodgate of your bounty and fill they to the very brim yet they|will always stand gape for more but do thou think his lady honest as woman flesh may be but she have be a courtier and therefore know most good methinks she will commit least ill o sir I will not but with sanctify and hallow thought touch sinthia bright beam who all eye do adore and heart do worship where pure chastity do shine in spotless robe of splendent majesty where nature emulate heaven to make she even as fair as she be virtuous but yet I well can wish you know that in the sky of court be many star the which at midnight shoot and fall true through most of the twelve sign for they shoot from their husband at Aries which govern the head and fall at Scorpio and so indeed they shoot from top to tail but honest wage will you bind i to you I think sir it|will not be so much for your health as if I shall keep you sollable I mean in courtesy good wage o the the very name of good wage will make a servingman do any courtesy then be friend i thus deliver this letter to your lady own hand with as much secrecy as you may and take this for your employment as secret as she that sell complexion none but the chambermaid shall know it
