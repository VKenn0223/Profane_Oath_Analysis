senator sometime prefer the rich before the best man take your seat to fill it fear will not let i sleep attend the message it seem from Hannibal a worthy man he send we home three bushel full of ring of which I share the most before I speak methinks the air about i as the sound of my sad word do pass through it shall thicken into a cloud then melt at every period into a weep rain till none be leave to give we breathe for sigh Oure Hannibal be vanquish by the roman we shall then have no more wealth bring home nor safe keep what we possess already curse on chance that mock we thus I|will

the name in equal competition meet to have conference where for a space they stand astonish at each other presence and like two comet tilt in the air against one another shoot prodigious flame from either eye and with a counterchange of fierce and angry look seem to begin a eager fight till Hannibal break silence and move a peace which Scipio or suspect it to be but wont policy or confident both of his own strength and success refuse then like two cloud swell big with a might tempest and hurry forward by contrary wind justle each other till their rib be break the sulphurous issue fly through the black air a inundation follow that will fright nature Archaeus from his quiet centre to seek a Aetna or vesaevus out where he may dry himself so meet the army and with a shout that outnoise

right wing of numidian horseman and break the|array enforce our first battle back to our second when we be compel to fight against our own lest their retire may put we out of order till betwixt we dead body make a bulwark so that neither we nor the roman but by trample on our fellow carcase can strike a blow of any use the roman legion now overpress we with their number and both wing of horseman wheel about to|assault our rear we then be compass yet like angry lion who the toil hamper labour for our freedom but few escape five hundred only live of forty thousand which to Adrumentum be flee with Hannibal whence he intend to visit Carthage sudden his welcome if he foreknow|it will give he small encouragement the|incertainty of war do Hannibal solicit peace I|will seem to|oppose it
