subtlety And be careful to commit injury will she not be careless to revenge they I must now fall from love to labour and endeavour with my oar to get a fare not with my pen to write a fancy love be but smoke which vanish in the see and yet hurt while they be see a ferry Phao no the star can call it a worse fortune range rather over the world forswear affection entreat for death o Sappho thou haste Cupid in thy arm I in my heart thou kiss he for sport I must curse he for spite yet will I not curse he Sappho who thou kiss this shall|be my resolution wherever I wander to be as I be ever kneel before Sappho my loyalty unspotted though unrewarded with as little malice will I go to my grave as I do lie with all in my cradle my life shall|be spend in sigh and wish the one for my bad fortune the other for Sappho good do so Phao for destiny call thou aswell from Sicily as from love other thing hang over thy head which I must neither tell nor thou inquire and so farewell farewell Sibylla and farewell Sicily thought shall|be thy food and in thy step shall|be print behind thou that there be none so loyal leave behind thou farewell Syracuse unworthy to harbour faith and when I be go unless Sappho be here unlikely to harbour any
