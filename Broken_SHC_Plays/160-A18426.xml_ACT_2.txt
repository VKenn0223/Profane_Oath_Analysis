in this solitary humour well these retire walk of she be not usual and bode some alteration in her thought what may be the cause Sthenio nay it|will trouble Argus with his hundred eye to descry the cause Venus keep she upright that she fall not from the state of her honour my fear be that some of these serpentine suitor will tempt she from her constant vow of widowhood if they do good night to our good day it|be a sin to suspect she I have be witness to so many of her fearful protestation to our late lord against that course to her infinite oath imprint on his lip and seal in his heart with such imprecation to her bed if ever it shall receive a second impression to her open and often detestation of that incestuous life as she term it of widow marriage as be but a kind of lawful adultery like usury permit by the law not approve that to wed a second be no better than to cuckold the first that woman shall entertain wedlock as one body as one life beyond which there be no desire no thought no repentance from it no restitution to it so as if the conscience of her vow shall not restrain she yet the world shame to break such a constant resolution shall repress any such motion in she well for her vow they be go to heaven with her husband they bind not upon earth and as for woman resolution I must tell you the planet and as Ptolemy say the wind have a great stroke in they trust
