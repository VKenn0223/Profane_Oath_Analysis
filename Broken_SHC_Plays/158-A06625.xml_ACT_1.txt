thou be a ferryman Phao yet a free man possess for riches content and for honour quiet thy thought be no high than thy fortune nor thy desire great than thy calling who climb stand on glass and fall on thorn thy heart thirst be satisfy with thy hand thrift and thy gentle labour in the day turn to sweet slumber in the night as much do it delight thou to rule thy oar in a calm stream as it do Sappho to sway the sceptre in her brave court envy never cast her eye low ambition point always upward and revenge bark only at star thou fare delicate if thou have a fare to buy any thing thy angle be ready when thy oar be idle and as sweet be the fish which thou get in the river as the fowl which other buy in the market thou need not fear poison in thy glass nor treason in thy guard the wind be thy great enemy who might be withstand with policy o sweet life seldom find under a golden covert often under a thatch cottage but here come one I will withdraw myself aside it may be a passenger it be no less unseemly than unwholesome for Venus who be most honour in prince court to sojourn with Vulcan in a smith forge where bellows blow in steed of sigh dark smoke rise for sweet perfume and for the pant of love heart be only hear the beat of steel hammer unhappy Venus that carry fire in thy own breast thou shall dwell with fire in his forge what do Vulcan all day but endeavour to be as crabbed in manner as he be crooked in body drive nail when he shall give kiss and hammer hard armour when he shall sing sweet amour it come by lot not love that I be link with he he give thou bolt Cupid instead of arrow fear belike jealous fool that he be that if he shall give thou a arrow head he shall make himself a broad head but come we will to Syracuse where thy deity shall be show and my disdain I will yoke the neck that yet never bow at which if jove repine jove shall repent Sappho shall know be she never so fair that there be a Venus which can conquer be she never so fortunate if jove espy Sappho he will devise some new shape to entertain she strike thou Sappho let jove devise what shape he can mother they say she have her thought in a string that she conquer affection and send love up and down upon errand I be afraid she will yerk i if I hit she peevish boy can mortal creature resist that which the immortal god can redress the god be amorous and therefore willing to be pierce and she amiable and therefore must be pierce I dare not draw thy arrow to the head else I will make thou repent it at the heart Come away and behold the ferry boy ready to conduct we pretty youth de you keep the ferry that bend to Syracuse the ferry fair lady that bend to Syracuse I fear if the water shall begin to swell thou will want cunning to guide these water be common as the passenger be and therefore carry one so fair in show there be no cause to fear a rough sea to pass the time in thy boat can thou devise any pastime if the wind be with i I can angle or tell tale if against i it will be pleasure for you to see i take pain I like not fish yet be I bear of the sea but he may bless fish that catch such a one in the sea it be not with a angle my boy but with a net So be it say that Vulcan catch Mars with Venus do thou hear so it be some tale yea madam and that in the boat I do mean to make my tale it be not for a ferry man to talk of the god love but to tell how thy father can dig and thy mother spin but come let we away I be ready to wait Pandion since your come from the university to the court from Athens to Syracuse how do you feel yourself alter either in humour or opinion alter Trachinus I say no more and shame that any shall know so much here you see as great virtue far great bravery the action of that which you contemplate Sappho fair by nature by birth royal learned by education by government politic rich by peace insomuch as it be hard to judge whether she be more beautiful or wise virtuous or fortunate beside do you not look on fair lady in steed of good letter and behold fair face instead of fine phrase in university virtue and vice be but shadow in colour white and black in court show to life good and bad there time past be read of in old book time present set down by new devise time to come conjecture at by aim by prophesy or chance here be time in perfection nor by devise as fable but in execution as truth believe i Pandion in Athens you have but tomb we in court the body you the picture of Venus and the wise goddess we the person and the virtue what have a scholar find out by study that a courtier have not find out by practice simple be you that think to see more at the candle snuff than the sun beam to sail further in a little brook then in the main ocean to make a great harvest by glean then reap How say you Pandion be not all this true Trachinus what will you more all true cease then to lead thy life in a study pin with a few board and endeavour to be a courtier to live in emboss ruff a labour intolerable for Pandion why because it be hard to shape a life to dissemble than to go forward with the liberty of truth why do you think in court any use to dissemble do you know in court any that mean to live you have no reason for it but a old report report have not always a blister on her tongue ay but this be the court of Sappho nature miracle which resemble the tree Salurus who root be fasten upon knot steel and in who top bud leaf of pure gold yet have Salurus blast and water bough worm and caterpillar the virtue of the tree be not the cause but the easterly wind which be think common to bring canker and rottenness nor the excellency of Sappho the occasion but the iniquity of flatterer who always whisper in prince ear suspicion and sourness why than you conclude with i that Sappho for virtue have no copartner yea and with the judgement of the world that she be without comparison we will thither straight I will I may return straight why there you may live still but not still how like you the lady be they not pass fair my eye drink neither the colour of wine nor woman yet be I sure that in judgement you be not so severe but that you can be content to allow of beauty by day or by night when I behold beauty before the sun his beam dim beauty when by candle beauty obscure torch light so as no time I can judge because at any time I can discern be in the sun a brightness to shadow beauty and in beauty a glister to extinguish light scholarlike say you flatter that which you seem to mislike and to disgrace that which you most wonder at but let we away I follow and you sir boy go to Syracuse about by land where you shall meet my stuff pay for the carriage and convey it to my lodging I think all your stuff be bundle of paper but now must you learn to turn your library to a war drop and see whether your rapier hang better by your side than the pen do in your ear Molus what odds between thy commons in Athens and the diet in court a page life and a scholar this difference there of a little I have somewhat here of a great deal nothing there do I wear pantofle on my leg here do I bear they in my hand thou may be skill in thy logic but not in thy lerypoope belike no meat can down with you unless you have a knife to cut it but come among we and you shall see we once in a morning have a mouse at a bay a mouse unproper speak apt understand a mouse of beef I think indeed a piece of beef as big as a mouse serve a great company of such cat but what else for other sport a square die in a page pocket be as decent as a square cap on a graduate head you courtier be mad fellow we silly soul be only plodder at ergo who wit be clasp up with our book and so full of learning be we at home that we scarce know good manner when we come abroad cunning in nothing but in make small thing great by figure pull on with the sweat of our study a great shoe upon a little foot burn out one candle in seek for another raw worldling in matter of substance pass wrangler about shadow then be it time lose to be a scholar we page be politian for look what we hear our master talk of you determine of where we suspect we undermine and where we mislike for some particular grudge there we pick quarrel for a general grief nothing among we but in steed of good morrow what news we fall from cog at dice to cog with state and so forward be mean man in those matter that they will be cock to tread down other before they be chicken to rise themselves youth be very forward to stroke their chin though they have no beard and to lie as loud as he that have live long these be the golden day then be they very dark day for I can see no gold you be gross witted master courtier and you master scholar slender witted I mean time which be prophesy golden for plenty of all thing sharpness of wit excellency in knowledge policy in government for soft scholaris I deny your argument why it be no argument then I deny it because it be no argument but let we go and follow our master be it not strange that Phao on the sudden shall be so fair it can be strange sith Venus be dispose to make he fair that cunning have be better bestow on woman which will have deserve thanks of nature happy she do in spite of woman or scorn of nature proud else how squeamish he be be come already use both disdainful look and imperious word insomuch that he gall with ingratitude and then lady you know how it cut a woman to become a wooer tush child and fool the fair they be the soon they yield a apple will catch the one a baby the other your lover I think be a fair fool for you love nothing but fruit and puppet I laugh at that you all call love and judge it only a word call love methinks like a courtesy a smile a beck and such like be the very quintessence of love ay Mileta but be you as wise as you will be think fair or as fair as you think yourself wise you will be as ready to please man as you be coy to prank yourself and as careful to be account amorous as you be willing to be think discrete no no man be good soul poor soul who never inquire but with their eye love to father the cradle though they but mother the child give i their gift not their virtue a grain of their gold weigh down a pound of their wit a dram of give i be heavy than a ounce of hear i believe i lady give be a pretty thing I can but oftentimes smile to myself to hear man call we weak vessel when they prove themselves break heart we frail when their thought can hang together study with word to flatter and with bribe to allure when we common wish their tongue in their purse they speak so simple and their offer in their belly they do it so peevish it be good sport to see they want matter for then fall they to good manner have nothing in their mouth but sweet mistress wear our hand out with courtly kiss when their wit fail in courtly discourse now ruffle their hair now set their ruff then gaze with their eye then sigh with a privy wring by the hand think we like to be woo by sign and ceremony yet we when we swear with our mouth we be not in love than we sigh from the heart and pine in love we be mad wench if man mark our word for when I say I will none care for love more than I what mean I but I will none love but I where we cry away do we not present say go to and when man strive for kiss we exclaim let we alone as though we will fall to that ourselves nay than Canope it be time to go and behold Phao where in your head Ismena nowhere else but let we keep on our way wise
