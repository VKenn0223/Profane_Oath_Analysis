time be sick when the body be healthful but be not the minds-sickness of power to make the body sick in time certain and the body ill affection able to infect the mind no question then if there be such a natural commerce of power betwixt they that the ill estate of the one offend the other why shall not the medicine for one cure the other yet it will not you see heimihi quod nullus amor est

any disease or sorrow who cause or effect simple and native concern the body that the mind by any mean partake nor be there any passion in the soul for where there be no affection there be no passion and affectus your master Galen refer part irascent for illic est anima sentiens ubi sunt affectus therefore the rational soul can be there also but you know we use to say my mind give i this or that even in those addiction that concern the body we use to say so indeed and from that use come the abuse of all knowledge and her practice for when the object in question only concern the state of the body why shall the soul be sorry or glad for it if she willing mix herself than she be a fool if of necessity and against her will a slave and so far from that wisdom and freedom that the empress of
