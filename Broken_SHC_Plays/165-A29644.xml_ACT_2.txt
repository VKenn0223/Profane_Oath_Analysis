do she appear so fair so lovely sir suppose you see a glorious firmament bedeck with heavenly star so shine her court with lady may be think of matchless beauty strike mere humane sight with admiration imagine now you see break through a veil amid those star though heavenly lesser beauty the bright Cynthia in her full of lustre so this no less to be compare queen shine above beauty to a
