shape but I shall look with the eye of mercy on it what will I give to see this diamond in her perfect lustre as she be before the cloud of sickness dim it yet take comfort and as you will obtain remission for his treachery to i cheer your droop spirit and call the blood again into your cheek and then plead for he and in such a habit as in your high hope you will put on if we be to receive you for our bride I|will do my best sir and that best will be a crown of all felicity to i
