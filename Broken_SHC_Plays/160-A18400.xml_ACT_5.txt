love your wife whereby you will seem to refuse she will you desire to have such a wife as no man can love but yourself answer but that Cornelio understand i say Dariotto have kiss your wife or perform other office of that nature whereby they do converse together at bed and at board as friend may seem to do mark but the now understand i yet if there come no proof but that her action be cleanly or indiscreet private why it|be a sign of modesty and will you blow 〈◊〉 Horne yourself when you may keep it to yourself go to you be a fool understand i do understand he Cornelio nay Cornelio I tell you again I know your father he be a wise gentleman and so be your mother methinks I see she yet a lusty stout woman bear great child you be the very scoundrel of they all but let that pass as for your mother she be wise a most flippant tongue she have and can set out her tail with as good grace as any she in Florence come cut and long-tail and she be honest enough too but yet by your leave she will tickle Dob now and then as well as the best on be by jove it|be true Cornelio I speak it not to flatter you your father know it well enough and will he do as you do think you set rascal to undermine she or look to her water as they say no when he see it|be but her humour for his own quietness sake he make a backdoor to his house for convenience get a bell to his fore door and have a odd fashion in ring by which she and her maid know he and will stand talk to his next neighbour to prolong time that all thing may be rid cleanly out of the way before he come for the credit of his wife this be wisdom now for a man own-quiet here be a man Cornelio what I say young man think old man be fool but old man know young man be fool why hark you you two knight do you think I will forsake Gazetta and will you not why there|be your wisdom why do I make show of divorce think you pray you why sir only to bridle her stout stomach and how do I draw on the colour for my divorce I do train the woodcock Dariotto into the net draw he to my house give he opportunity with my wife as you say my father deal with his wife friend only to train he in let he alone with my wife in her bedchamber and sometime find he a bed with she and go my way back again soft only to draw he into the pit this be well handle in deed Cornelio I marry sir now I commend your wisdom why if I have be so mind as you think I can have fling his patofle down the stair or do he some other disgrace but I wink at it and draw on the good fool more and more only to bring he within my compass why this be policy in grain and now shall the world see I be as wise as my father be|it come to this then will I make a speech in praise of this reconcilement include therein the praise and honour of the most fashionable and authentical horn stand close gentle and be silent come on let|we hear his wit in this potable humour the course of the world like the life of man be say to be divide into several age as we into infancy childhood youth and so forward to old-age so the world into the golden age the silver the brass the iron the leaden the wooden and now into this present age which we term the horned age not that but former age have injoyde this benefit as well as our time but that in we it be more common and nevertheless precious it be say that in the golden age of the world the use of gold be not then know a argument of the simplicity of that age lest therefore succeed age shall hereafter impute the same fault to we which we lay upon the first age that we live in the horn age of the world shall not understand the use the virtue the honour and the very royalty of the horn I will in brief sound the praise thereof that they who be already in possession of it may bear their head aloft as be proud of such lofty accoutrement and they that be but in possibility may be ravish with a desire to be in possession a trophy so honourable and unmatchable powerful that it be able to raise any man from a beggar to a emperor fellow a duke fellow a nobleman fellow alderman fellow so glorious that it deserve to be wear by most opinion in the most conspicuous place about a man for what worthy crest can you bear then the horn which if it may be see with our mortal eye what a wonderful spectacle will there be and how high they will ravish the beholder but their substance be incorporal not fall under sense nor mix of the gross concretion of element but a quintessence beyond they a spiritual essence invisible and everlasting and this have be the cause that many man have call their be in question whether there be such a thing in verum nacura or not because they be not to be see as though nothing be that be not to be see whoever see the wind yet what wonderful effect be see of it it drive the cloud yet no man see it it rock the house bear down tree castle steeple yet who see it in like sort do your horn it swell the forehead yet none see it it rock the cradle yet none see it so that you plain perceive sense be no judge of essence the moon to any man sense seem to be horn yet who know not the moon to be ever perfect round so likewise your head seem ever to be round when in deed they be oftentimes horn for their original it be unsearchable natural they be not for there be beast bear with horn more than with tooth create they be not for ex nihilo nihil sit then will you ask i how come they into the world I know not but I be sure woman bring they into this part of the world howsoever some doctor be of opinion that they come in with the devil and not unlike for as the devil bring sin into the world but the woman bring it to the man so it may very well be that the devil bring horn into the world but the woman bring they to the man for their power it be general over the world no nation so barbarous no country so proud but do equal homage to the horn Europa when she be carry through the sea by the saturnian bull be say for fear of fall to have hold by the horn and what be this but a plain show to we that all Europa which take name from that Europa shall likewise hold by the horn so that I say it be universal over the face of the world general over the face of Europe and common over the face of this country what city what town what village what street nay what house can quit itself of this prerogative I have read that the lion once make a proclamation through all the forest that all horn beast shall depart forthwith upon pain of death if this proclamation shall be make through our forest lord what press what run what fly will there be even from all the part of it he that have but a bunch of flesh in his head will away and some foolish fearful will imagine the shadow of his ear to be horn alas how desert will this forest be leave to conclude for there force it be irrefutable for be they not inevitable then may either properness of person secure a man or wisdom prevent be or greatness exempt or riches redeem they but present experience have teach we that in this case all these stand in no stead for we see the proper man take part of they the best wit can avoid they for then shall poet be no cuckold nor can money redeem they for then will rich-man fine for their horn as they do for office but this be hold for a maxim that there be more rich cuckold then poor last for continuance of the horn it be undeterminable till death neither do they determine with the wife death howsoever ignorant writer hold opinion they do for as when a knight die his lady still retain the title of lady when a company be cast yet the captain still retain the title of captain so though the wife die by who this title come to her husband yet by the courtesy of the city he shall|be a cuckold during life let all ignorant ass prate what they list and you sir come join hand you|be one among they
