with Tellus fair Tellus have I dissemble use she but as a cloak for my affection that other see my mangle and disorder mind may think it be for one that love i not for Cynthia who perfection allow no companion nor comparison in the midst of these distemper thought of i thou be not only jealous of my truth but careless suspicious and secure which strange humour make my mind as desperate as thy conceit be doubtful I be none of those wolf that bark most when thou shine bright but that fish thy fish Cynthia in the flood Aranis which at thy wax be as white as the drive snow and at thy wane as black as deep darkness I be that Endymion sweet Cynthia that have carry my thought in equal balance with my action be always as free from imagine ill as enterprise that Endymion who eye never esteem any thing fair but thy face who tongue term nothing rare but thy virtue and who heart imagine nothing miraculous but thy government yea that Endymion who divorce himself from the amiableness of all lady the bravery of all court the company of all man have choose in a solitary cell to live only by feed on thy favour account in the world but thyself nothing excellent nothing immortal thus may thou see every vain sinew muscle and artery of my love in which there be no flattery nor deceit error nor art but soft here come Tellus I must turn my other face to her like janus lest she be as suspicious as Juno yonder I espy Endymion I will seem to suspect nothing but soothe he that see I can obtain the depth of his love I may learn the height of his dissemble Floscula and Dipsas withdraw yourselves out of our sight yet be within the hear of our salute how now Endymion always solitary no company but your own thought no friend but melancholy fancy you know fair Tellus that the sweet remembrance of

Endymion without more ceremony be it not Cynthia you know tellus that of the god we be forbid to dispute because their deity come not within the compass of our reason and of Cynthia we be allow not to talk but to wonder because her virtue be not within the reach of our capacity why she be but a woman no more be Venus Shee be but a virgin no more be Vesta she shall have a end so shall the world be not her beauty subject to time no more than time be to stand still will thou make she immortal no but incomparable take heed Endymion lest like the wrestler in Olimpia that strive to lift a impossible weight catch a incurable strain thou by fix thy thought above thy reach fall into a disease without all recure but I see thou be now in love with Cynthia no Tellus thou know that the stately cedar who top reach unto the cloud never bow his head to the shrub that grow in the valley nor ivy that climb up by the elm can ever get hold of the beam of the sun Cynthia I honour in all humility who none

hideous beast love be pap and have no relish in my taste because it be not terrible indeed a black sheep be a perilous beast but let we in till another time I shall long for that time no rest Endymion still uncertain how to settle thy step by day or thy thought by night thy truth be measure by thy fortune and thou be judge unfaithful because thou be unhappy I will see if I can beguile myself with sleep and if no slumber will take hold in my eye yet will I embrace the golden thought in my head and wish to melt by muse that as ebony which no fire can scorch be yet consume with sweet savour so my heart which can be bend by the hardness of fortune may be bruise by amorous desire on yonder bank never grow any thing but lunary and hereafter I will never have any bed but that bank o Endymion Tellus be fair but what avail beauty without wisdom nay Endymion she be wise but what avail wisdom without honour Shee be honourable Endymion belie she not I but how obscure be honour without fortune be she not fortunate who so many follow yes yes but base be fortune without majesty thy majesty Cynthia all the world know and wonder at but not one in the world that can imitate it or comprehend it no more Endymion sleep or die nay die for to sleep it be impossible and yet I know not how it come to pass I feel such a heaviness both in my eye and heart that I be sudden benumb yea in every joint it may be weariness for when do I rest it may be deep melancholy for when do I not sigh Cynthia I so I say Cynthia little do thou know Endymion when thou shall wake for have thou place thy heart as low in love as thy head lie now in sleep thou may have command Tellus who now in stead of a mistress thou shall find a tomb these eye must I seal up by art not nature which be to be open neither by art nor nature thou that lie down with golden lock shall not awake until they be turn to silver hair and that chin on which scarce appear soft down shall|be fill with bristle as hard as broom thou shall sleep out thy youth and flower time and become dry hay before thou know thyself green grass and ready by age to step into the grave when thou wake that be youthful in the court when thou lay thou down to sleep the malice of Tellus have bring this to pass which if she can not have entreat of i by fair mean she will have command by menace for from her gather we all our simples to maintain our sorcery fan with this hemlock over his face and sing the enchantment for sleep while I go in and finish those ceremony that be require in our art take heed you touch not his face for the fan be so season that who so it touch with a leaf shall present die and over who the wind of it breathe he shall sleep for ever let i alone I will be careful what hap have thou Endymion to come under the hand of Dipsas o fair Endymion how it grieve i that that fair face must be turn to a wither skin and taste the pain of death before it feel the reward of love I fear tellus will repent that which the heaven themselves seem to rue but I hear Dipsas come I dare not repine lest she make i pine and rock i into such a deep sleep that I shall not awake to my marriage how now have you finish yea well then let we in and see that you do not so much as whisper that I do this for if you do I will turn thy hair to adder and all thy tooth in thy head to tongue come away come away
