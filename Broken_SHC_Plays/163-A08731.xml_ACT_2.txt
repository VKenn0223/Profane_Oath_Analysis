lawful to change as often as we will what the lady the discourse of they and themselves too if we can arrive to it but what be she you love one that I will sacrifice half my life to have but a week enjoy of at these game of love we set all but the best be we can stake and there|be no loss of credit in the break Cleon have thou see he with his mistress yes and he stand gaze on she as if he be beg of a alm it|be not ill do but do he not speak to she never but in hyperbole tell she her eye be star which astronomer shall only study to know our fate by it|be not amiss if she have neither of the extreme what do you intend I mean neither so ill favour as to have no ground for what we say for their belief will hardly enter nor so handsome as to have it often speak to she for your indifferent beauty be those who flattery surprise there be so natural a love and opinion of ourselves that we be adapt to believe that man be rather deceive in we than abuse we your limitation take away much of my answer but grant all that you say I have no hope of obtain my mistress then thou have yet a year of happiness but why I prithee she be so deserve she think none worthy of her affection and so can love none you have more cause to doubt that she will never affect you than that already she be not in love what a young handsome lady that carry the flame of her heart in her cheek not have yet see any one to desire it|be impossible I be of your mind till I have experience of the contrary conceit of yourself make you of the opinion I mention you think it|be impossible for all man what you can attain to what art have you use to gain she he know none but distil sigh at the altar of her beauty if he be subject to that frenzy I will counsel he to take any trade upon he rather than that of love and do you think there be any thing fit to call down affection than submission nothing more opposite for languish transport whining and melancholy make we more laugh at than belove of our mistress and with reason for why shall we hope to deserve their favour when we confess we merit not a lawful esteem of ourselves I have know some their mistress have forsake only because they be certain the world take notice they be deep in love with they and they do wise for the victory be get they be to prepare for a new triumph and not like your city officer ride still with the same livery some I confess have miscarry in it but it|be because their provision of beauty be spend before they come to composition thou be|it a excellent fool in a chamber if you continue you|will be so in a comedy do believe thou can swagger they out of their love soon than soften their heart by my tear and though a river shall run through i I will seal up my eye before a drop shall come that way for our unmanly submission raise they to that height that they think we be large favour if they harken to we with contempt it|be safe they shall do so than hate we for our insolence if thou have ever be use to talk sense I shall wonder at thou now why I shall soon hope to gain a lady after the murder of her family than after she have a opinion I deserve to be slight by she before Venus he talk with authority I know not well what he have say but methinks there be something in it prithee let|we hearken to he do and if I do not dispossess you of all your opinion let i be you must deal by enchantment then for I be resolve to stick to my conclusion it|be the best holdfast your foolish devil have but strong reason shall be your exorcism tell i first what be she you love will I can then for all thy jest there|be some hope thou be yet in thy wit you mistake i I mean I can not tell because no tongue can speak she to her merit heyday if the ballad of the rose and the honeycomb do not do it more than she deserve or almost any woman let i be condemn to sing the funeral of parrot will the lady hear you they will believe i though they will be sorry your honour shall but what this love have it transform we all Cleon you can tell who it|be he thus admire yes and will it|be Hermione Pindarus his heir Ph what Epictetus in a petticoat she that dispute love into nothing or what|be worse a friendship with a woman the same and I know you|will confess she|be deserve yes but the mischief be she|will never think so of he if polygamy be in fashion I will persuade he to marry she to be governess to the rest but not till then will thou be content to lie with a statue that will never confess more of love than suffer the effect of thou and have his liberty in the discourse of her friend that her retiredness may be more magnify believe i ERGASTO these severe beauty that be to be look on with the eye of respect be not for we we must have they that love to be praise more for fair lady than judicious you mistake i gentleman I choose for myself not for you faith for that whoever marry must sacrifice to fortune and she who wisdom make her snow to you may be fire to another some odd wrinkle fellow that conquer she with wit may throw she on her back with reason take this from the oracle that for the general calamity of husband all woman be repute vicious and for the quiet of particular every one think his wife the phoenix you have meet with rare fortune calumny be so general that truth have lose her credit but to the|purpose what rival what hope a potent rival take away all Lysicles do woe her good night I will dispute it no more whether thou shall have she or no for now I conclude it be impossible I have her father firm consent before he declare himself though thou have she too be wise and despair betimes in this point woman be commonwealth and be oblige to their faith no far than the safety and honour of the state be concern if thou be|it the first example I will excuse thou for be the first cozen but stay who|be here of|my conscience a embassage from some of your kind mistress that will fain take their leaf before you go to captivity be|it possible she desire you to see she and believe that ambition can gain more upon she than your affection take this ring and this I dare not sir I|will pay thy dowry then within this half hour I|will wait on she from what part of the town come this fair day in a cloud that make you look so cheerful a alas gentleman I be bear to know nothing of love but sigh and despair I can be servant to none that have the election of two unriddle unriddle it be the servant of Hermione that come to have nigh wait upon her lady Phormio what do you think of this I will think at all for fear I judge amiss the maze of a woman be so intricate no precept can secure we yet this I be resolve on she will not love you why send she for he then the devil that advise she can tell you they will not lose a servant while he live though they command he to be murder it|be the woman art if they perceive a lover to desist through fear distrust or harsh usage they open he the heaven of their beauty in smile and yield look and with their eye do melt the ice of doubt their fear contract perhaps prince Lysicles spur cold while he ride alone and you must strain to make he go the fast Eugenio too be servant to your mistress and Lysicles and he part good friend shall I think all the way they have to cozen they it|be endless but I|will along with you and guess at more
