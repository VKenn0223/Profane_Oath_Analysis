treachery thou have pamper up thyself with slaughter as Diomedes do his horse with blood so unsatiable thy thirst so heavy thy sword two book have I always carry in my bosom call they the dagger and the sword in which the name of all prince nobleman and gentleman be dedicate to slaughter or if not which worse be to slavery o my lord when I call to mind my cruelty in Lycaonia my usurp in Getulia my oppression in Sola then do I find neither mercy in my conquest nor colour for my war nor measure in my tax I have write my law in blood and make my god of gold I have cause the mother womb to be their child tomb cradle to swim in blood like boat and the temple of the god a stew for strumpet have not I make the sea to groan under the number of my ship and have they not perish that there be not two leave to make a number have I not thrust my subject into a camp like ox into a cart who have make slave by unjust war I use now as slave for all war have not I entice the subject of my neighbour prince to destroy their natural king like moth that eat the cloth in which they be breed like viper that gnaw the bowel of which they be bear and like worm that consume the wood in which they be engender to what kingdom have not I pretend claim as though I have be by the god create heir apparent to the world make every trifle a title and all the territory about i traitor to i why do I wish

wonder for wisdom and temperance that be his own strength do not all his subject like bee swarm to preserve the king of bee that their loyalty maintain my lord I faint both for lack of food and want of grace I will to the river where if I be rid of this intolerable disease of gold I will next shake off that untemperate desire of government and measure my territory not by the greatness of my mind

little king be a king and the title consist not in the compass of ground but in the right of inheritance be not conquest good title conquest be great theft if your highness will be advise by i then will I rob for kingdom and if I obtain fain will I see he that dare call the conqueror a thief Martius thy council have shed as much blood as will make another sea valour I can call it and

pastime shall we use to pass the time I will agree to any so it be not to talk of love then sleep be the best exercise why Suavia be you so light that you must chat of love or so heavy that you must needs sleep Penelope in the absence of her lord beguile the day with spin indeed she spin a fair thread if it be to make a string to the bow wherein she draw herwoers why Suavia it be a bow which she know to be above thy strength and therein she show her wit Qui latus arguerit corneus arcu erat it be make of horn madam and therein she show her meaning why do thou not think she be chaste yes of all her wooer to talk with thou be to lose time not well to spend it how say you Amerula what shall we do tell tale what say you Caelia Sing what think you Camilla dance you see Suavia that there be other thing to keep one from idleness beside love nay that there be nothing to make idleness but love well let i stand by and feed my own thought with sweetness while they fill your eye and ear with song and dance Amerula begin thy tale there dwell sometime in Phrygia a lady very fair but pass froward as much marvel at for beauty as for peevishness mislike high she be in the instep but short in the heel straight lace but loose body it come to pass that a gentleman as young in wit as year and in year a very boy chance to glance his eye on she and there be they dazzle on her beauty as lark that be catch in the sun with the glitter of a glass in her fair look be his thought entangle like the bird of canary that fall into a silken net dote he do without measure and die he must without her love she on the other side as one that know her good begin to look askance yet feel the passion of love eat into her heart though she dissemble they with her eye ha ha he why laugh thou to see you madam so tame as to be bring to hear a tale of love that before be so wild you will not come to the name and that Amerula can devise how to spend the time with a tale only that she may not talk of love and now to make love only her tale Indeed I be overshoot in judgement and she in discretion Amerula another tale or none this be too lovely nay let i hear any woman tell a tale of x. line long without it tend to love and I will be bind never to come at the court and you Caelia that will fain trip on your pettitoe can you persuade i to take delight to dance and not love or you that can rule your foot can guide your affection have the one as unstaid as the other unsteady dance be love sauce therefore I dare be so saucy as if you love to dance to say you dance for love but Camilla she will sing who voice if it shall utter her thought will make the tune of a heart out of tune she that have crotchet in her head have also love conceit I dare swear she harp not only on plain song and before you Sophronia none of they all use plain deal but because they see you so curious they frame themselves counterfeit for myself as I know honest love to be a thing inseparable from our sex so do I think it most allowable in the court unless we will have all our thought make of church-work and so carry a holy face and a hollow heart lady how like you Suavia in her love vain we be content at this time to soothe she in her vanity Shee cast all our mind in the mould of her own head and yet err as far from our meaning as she do from her own modesty Amerula if you be not bitter your name have be ill bestow but I think it as lawful in the court to be count love and chaste as you in the temple to seem religious and be spiteful I marvel you will reply any more Amerula her tongue be so nimble it will never lie still the like thy foot Camilla which be teach not to stand still So no more lady let our come to sport not turn to spite love thou Suavia if thou think it sweet sing thou Caelia for thy own content tell thou tale and dance thou Camilla and so every one use her own delight shall have no cause to be discontent but here come Martius and the rest what news Martius of my sovereign and father Midas madam he no soon bathe his limb in the river but it turn to a golden stream the sand to fine gold and all to gold that be cast into the water Midas dismay at the sudden alteration assay again to touch a stone but he can not alter the nature of the stone then go we with he to the temple of Bacchus where we offer a lance wreathe about with ivy garland of ripe grape and skin of wolf and panther and a great stand cup of the water which so late be turn to gold Bacchus accept our gift command Midas to honour the god and also in wish to be as wise as he mean to have make he fortunate happy Sophronia that have live to hear these news and happy Midas if thou live better to govern thy fortune but what be become of our king Midas overjoy with this good fortune determine to use some solace in the wood where by chance we rouse a great bear he eager of the sport outride we and we think he have be come to his palace some other way come ourselves the next way if he be not return he can be long we have also lose our page which we think be with he the god shield he from all harm the wood be full of tiger and he of courage wild beast make no difference between a king and a clown nor hunter in the heat of their pastime fear no more the fierceness of the boar than the fearfulness of the hare but I hope well let we in to see all well
