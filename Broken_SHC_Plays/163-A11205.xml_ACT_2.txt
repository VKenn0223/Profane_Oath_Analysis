this day the sun shoot forth his beam as fair as ere he do and through the tremble air cool Zephyrus with gentle murmur breathe a new freshness on each tree and plant my kid as game some too as ere they be all show a face of gladness but myself not in this life here joy will be untimely the god reserve for i their comfort in the elyzian field or else they mock my sorrow they be but father so I still must call you when in the sadness of my soul I ask before the altar of our great Apollo what shall become of i or where my love bright Silvia be whether alive or dead why shall the oracle reply go home thou shall enjoy thy Silvia what more can you desire to hear ay but when greedy I ask the time the answer be that day thou be not Thirsis nor she Silvia then in this life I|be sure it must not be for I be Thyrsis ever call and she know by no other name then Sylvia it may be for your importunity you may deserve this answer or else be it because the god speak not their mystery to be conceive by every vulgar sense I now remember what Acrisius the wise and virtuous Acrisius be wont to say why what say he do it concern i aught it may do son he bid we fly all curiosity seek to know what future time may bring to we which only god above do know and if at any time they do impart this knowledge unto we it be enwrap in such a mist as we shall never see through it because say he we have enough to do with what be present the celestial power will not cut of our hope nor multiply our care by show we our destiny o this discourse to a despair lover what comfort do it bring for heaven sake leave it and i for I be best I find alone yet stay there|be something that I fain will ask you you say this circle here about my neck have so continue from my infancy when first you take i up it|be true that circle hang loose then about your neck which since be fill with it I leave it there because I see some letter that be wrought about it I think they may but I can never find so great a clerk as can tell how to|expound the meaning of they my life be nothing but a mystery that which I be and that which I shall be be equal unknown now if you|will leave i unto my thought they|will keep i company ay let i alone he that mourn for a mistress when he know not where she be let he kiss her shadow fair or engender with the air or see if with his tear he can swell at a ebb the ocean then if he have not rather die let he love none or all as I this be the doctrine that I ever teach you and yet you profit not these scurvy passion hang on you still you that be young and active that may have all our nymph at your devotion to live a whine kind of life as this how ill it do become you true Mirtillus and yet I do not envy thou the pleasure thou have in thy disperse affection you will if your head be right once but love your love do make a ass of all your reason sure a true lover be more rational than you that love at random everywhere I do not think so all the reason love have leave you to employ in this discourse will hardly bring i to confess it to you why all man action have some proper end whereto their mean and strict endeavour tend else there will be nought but perplexity in humane life and all uncertainty that you who know no end at all of wild desire must in your wander fancy see this way lead unto madness when too late you find that nothing satisfy a boundless mind ay but I do confine myself to two or three at most in this variety I please myself for what be want in one I may find it in another no not in another one be the only centre the line of love be draw to must have all perfection in she all that|be good and fair or else her lover must believe she so ay there|be your error that|be the ground of all your tear and sigh your fruitless hope and fear when

lose or dead ay i the sad remembrance of my Sylvia cause this yet I must love because the character be indelible write in my heart and heaven be witness to it well I|will no more of this I|will be convert rather than call this grief to your remembrance why do thou think I ever shall forget she or that where ere I set my careful foot as in this place will it not tell i that here Sylvia and I walk hand in hand and here she pluck a flower and anon she give it i and than we kiss and here we mutual do vow each other love nay leave good Thyrsis I do come to tell you this holiday our royal
