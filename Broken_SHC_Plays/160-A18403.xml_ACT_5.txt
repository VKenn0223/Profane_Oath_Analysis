have reward proportion to their labour yet may implore their own confusion for any thing they know which oftentimes it fall out they incur so nature lay a mass of stuff together and by use or by the mere necessity of matter end such a work fill it or leave it empty of strength or virtue error or clear truth not know what she do but usual give that which we call merit to a man and believe shall arrive he on huge riches honour and happiness that effect his ruin right as in ship of war whole last of powder be lay man think to make they last and guard they when a disorder spark that powder take

and since it let they pass through let it stand but a tree solid since it give no way to their wild rage they rend up by the root so this full creature now shall reel and fall before the frantic puff of purblind chance that pipe through empty man and make they dance not so the sea rave on the lybian sand tumble her billow in each other neck not so the surge of the euxine sea near to the frosty pole where free Boötes from those dark-deep wave turn his radiant team swell be enrage even from their inmost drop as fortune swing about the restless state of virtue now throw into all man hate revive those stupid thought and sit not thus gather the horror of your servant slaughter so urge by your hand and so imminent into a idle fancy but devise how to prevent it watch when he shall rise and with a sudden outcry of his murder blow his retreat before he be engage o father have my dumb woe wake your death when will our humane grief be at their height man be a tree that have no top in
