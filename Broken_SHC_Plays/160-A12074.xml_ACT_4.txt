of all honest animal your cuckold be the best for he be sure a gentleman and know by his crest of all occupation that ever man profess in my opinion still do hold the cutpurse be the best and if that fail knight go to church and pray for vengeance wing bring on thy lethal day then come sweet wife let|we in and wage thy pain deserve to be requite for separate heart have thou unite why have I not a good leg do I not always wear clean line be not my hand wash my beard comb my cloak brush and my shoe black every morning true why the more vile strumpet she to cuckold you but how do know she be with child know it why she|be daily trouble with water pang and quake over her stomach indeed I must needs say that|be a great proof she have fill her belly with something that stand against her stomach but do not think it|be my child you why how can|it be you be you not circumcise to the quick yes and the remembrance of it gall i that|be a sign you be too patient and like a ass endure all without resistance ha ha ha but why do you laugh sir to think who the child will be like why you who shall it be like else why it|be none of my man why the more like you for that why do you not not know the philosopher hold the child be always like the party which the mother think off in the conception now she think most of you for fear you shall have come the while and that|be the reason so many gentleman son be like your citizen and call they father too for otherwise how can it be that a young cockney be leave forty or fiftiie thousand pound spend all within so many month but that some young gallant beget he for you know the prover be cat will after kind no have the old citizen beget he he will a bit a fig in two to have make just weight and have have a pot with a false bottom rather than a sell too much measure he will have do all thing within measure as your old citizen do and not a spend all beyond measure as your young gallant do but be not I best go home and use she well till the child be bear to see if it be like i that I may be sure it|be none of i o no that be base and as deceitful as the colic when it break out in wind which level at a man heel and it strike he in the nose therefore never make a show of one thing and do another but put she away rid your hand of she and there|be a end I think who|be the father of the bastard why who|be the father of a punk child be|it not filius populi it may have two father for any thing we know well slack I do very much mistrust wage too for he be grow very familiar of late true sir and take her part too and you mark he I mark he
