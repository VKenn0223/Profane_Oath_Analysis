EPhestion thou do Alexander love Craterus thou the king yet both you meet in oneself point of loyalty and love and both I find like careful like discreet therefore my faithful counsellor to you I must a weighty accident impart which lie so heavy as I tell you true I find the burden much to|oppress my heart ingratitude and stubborn carriage in one of who my love deserve respect be that which move my passion into rage and be a thing I ought not to neglect you see how I Philotas raise have above his rank his peer beyond his term you see the place the office I give as the|earnest of my love to bind his firm but all he deem rather his desert than the effect of my grace any way begin to play most peremptory part as fit to control then to obey and I have be inform he foster too the faction of that home-bent cowardice that will run back from glory and undo all the whole wonder of our enterprise and one day to ourself presume to write seem our style and title to upbraid which the|oracle themselves hold requisite and which not I but man on i have lay and say he pity those who under he shall live who hold himself the son of jupiter alas good man as though what breath can give can make my own thought other than they be I that be arbiter betwixt my heart and their opinion know how it stand within and find that my infirmity take part of that same frailty other man live in and yet what if I be dispose to wink at the|entertain opinion spread so far and rather be content the world shall think we other than we be then what we be in do which I know I be not go beyond example see that majesty need all the prop of admiration that may be get to bear it up on high and much more my which but even now begin by miracle of fortune and our worth needs all the compliment to rest upon that reverence and opinion can bring forth which this wise man conceive not and yet take upon he to instruct we what to do but these be but the flourish he make of great malice he be bend unto for sure methinks I view within his face the map of change and innovation I see his pride content with no place unless it be the throne I sit upon have I not hear this from your sacred tongue dear sovereign I will never have believe Philotas folly will have do that wrong to|his own worth and the|honour he receive and yet methinks of late his carriage in such exceed pomp and gallantry and such a world of follower do presage that he affect popularity especial since for his service do he be adjudge to have the second place in honour with Antigonus which win to some the|opinion to be high in grace then this last action lead the right wing and the|overthrow he give may hap enlarge the|opinion of himself consider the|especial grace and honour of his charge whereby perhaps in rate his own worth his pride may undervalue that great grace from whence it grow and that which put he forth And make his fortune suit to the place but yet I think he be not so unwise although his fortune youth and jollity make he thus mad as he will enterprise aught against course his faith and loyalty and therefore if your grace do but withdraw those beam of favour which do daze his want he will be soon reduce to|his rank of awe and know himself and bear he as befit withdraw our grace and how can that be do without some sollevation to ensue can he be safe bring in be so far go I hold it not say Craterus what think you sovereign I know the man I find his spirit and malice shall not make i I protest speak other than I know his pride do merit and what I speak be for your interest which long ere this I will have utter but that I fear your majesty will take that from some private grudge it rather breed then out of care for your dear sister sake or rather that I seek to cross your grace or to confine your favour within bound and find he to hold so high a place in that divine conceit which we confound I think the safe way to let it rest in hope that time some passage open will to let in those clear look into that breast that do but malice and confusion hold and now I see you have discern the man who I protest I hold most dangerous and that you ought with all the speed you can work to repress a spirit so mutinous for even already he be swell so high that his affection overflow the brim of his own power not able to deny passage unto the thought that govern he for but even now I hear a strange report of speech he shall use to|his courtesan vaunt what he have do and in what sort he labour to advance that proud young man so term of your sacred majesty with other such extravagant discourse whereof we shall attain more certainty I doubt not short and descry his course meanwhile about your person I advise your grace shall call a more sufficient guard and on his action set such wary eye as may thereof take special good regard and note what person chief he frequent and who to he have the most free access how he bestow his time where he present the large revenue of his bounteousness and for his wench that lie betwixt his arm And know his hare I will about with she she shall|be wrought to|apply her usual charm and I will make she my discoverer Alex this counsel Craterus we do well allow and give thou many thanks for thy great care but yet we must bear fair lest he shall know that we suspect what his affection be for that you see he hold aside of power which may perhaps call up some mutiny his father old Parmenio at this hour rule Medea with no lesser power than I himself you see gallant follow hold next to we a special government Canus that with his sister marry have under he again commandment Amintas and symanus he dear friend with both their honourable office and then the private train that on they tend with all particular dependence be motive to advice we how to deal crat your grace say true but yet these cloud of smoke vanish before the sun of that respect whereon man long-inured affection look with such a native zeal and so affect as that the vain and shallow practise of no such giddy traitor if the thing be take in time with due advisedness shall the least show of any feeling bring Alex well then to thou dear Craterus I refer the|especial care of this great business my lord I here have long attendance make expect to be call to|avouch my news in troth my friend I have not find the king at any leisure yet to hear the same no not at leisure to prevent his death and be the matter of no more import I|will try another yet methinks such man as be the eye and ear of prince shall not weigh so light such a intelligence my lord the sum you will i to give the captain that do visit you today to tell you plain your coffers yield it not how if they yield it not have I not then apparel plate jewel why sell they Plutarch in the life of Alexander and go your way dispatch and give it he methinks I find the king much change of late and unto i his grace not so great although they seem in show all of one rate yet by the touch I find they counterfeit for when I speak although I have his ear yet do I see his mind be other where and when he speak to i I see he strive to give a colour unto what be not for he must think that we who state who live depend upon his grace learn not by rote to|observe his action and to know his trim and though indeed prince be manifold yet have they still such eye to wait on they as be to pierce that they can behold and penetrate the innards of the heart that no device can set so close a door betwixt their show and thought but that their art of shadow it make it appear the more but many malice my state of grace I know do work with all the power they have upon that easy nature to displace my fortune and my action to deprave and though I know they seek to|enclose he in and fain will lock he up and chamber he yet will I never stoop and seek to win my way by they that come not in by they and scorn to stand on any other foot then these of my own worth and what my plain and open action can fair get baseness and soothe they shall never gain and yet I know my presence and access clear all these mist which they have raise before though with my back straight turn that happiness and they again blow up as much or more thus do we role the stone of our own toil and man suppose our hell a heaven the while ANtigona there be no remedy you needs must justify the speech you hold with Thais who will your conference verify and therefore now it can be conceal o my good lord I pray you urge i not Thais only of a cunning envious wit scorn a stranger shall have such allot have out of her invention forge it why then shall rack and torture force thou show both this and other matter which we know think therefore if it|be not a wise part to|accept of rest reward preferment grace and be perhaps so beauteous as thou be of fair election for a near place to tell the truth than to be obstinate and fall with the misfortune of a man who in his dangerous and concuss state no good to thou but ruin render resolve thou of this choice and let i know thy mind at full at my return back what shall I do shall I betray my love or die disgrace what do I make a doubt betray my love o heavenly power above forbid that such a thought shall issue out of this confuse breast nay rather first let torture death and horror do their worst but out alas this inconsiderate tongue without my heart consent and privity have do already this unwilling wrong and now it be no wisdom to deny no wisdom to deny yes yes that tongue that thus have be the traitor to my heart shall either powerful redeem that wrong or never more shall word of breath impart yet what can my denial profit he who they perhaps whether I tell or not be purpose upon matter know to they to ruinate on some discover plot let they do what they will let not thy heart seem to be accessary in a thought to give the left advantage of thy part to have a part of shame in what be wrought o this be well if that my danger can redeem his peril and his grace restore for which I vow my life I render will if this poor life can satisfy therefore but it|be not for thy honour to forsake thy love for death that love thou in this sort alas what notice will the world take of such respect in woman of my sort this act may yet put on so fair a coat upon my foul profession as it may not blush to|appear with those of clean note and have as high a place with fame as they what do I talk of fame do I not see this faction of my flesh my fear my youth already enter and have bend at i the joy of life to batter down my truth o my subdue thought what have you do to let in fear and falsehood to my heart who though they have surprise they have not win for still my love shall hold the dear part Antigona what be you yet resolve resolve my lord to|endure all misery and so be sure you shall if that by|your choice what will you have i do my lord I be content to say what you will have i say then come go with i to Alexander how do thou wear and weary out thy day restless ambition never at a end who travail not Herculean pillar stay but still beyond thy rest thy labor tend above good fortune thou thy hope do raise still climb and yet never can ascend for when thou have attain unto the top of thy desire thou have not yet get up that hey of fortune either be control by some more powerful overlook eye that do the fullness of thy grace withhold or countercheck with some concurrency that it do cost far more ado to hold the high attain then be to get so high where stand thou can not but with careful toil nor lose thy hold without thy utter spoil there do thou struggle with thy own distrust and other jealousy their counterplot against some underwork pride that must supplant be or else thou stand not there wrong be pay with wrong and he that thrust down other come himself to have that lot the same concussion do afflict his breast that other shake oppression be oppress that either happiness dwell not so high or else above whereto pride can rise and that the high of man felicity but in the region of affliction lie and that we climb but up to misery high fortune be but high calamity it be not in that sphere where peace do move rest dwell below it happiness above for in this height of fortune be imbred those thunder fragor that affright the earth from thence have all distemperature their head that bring forth desolation famine dearth there certain order be disorder and there it be confusion have her birth it be that high of fortune do undo both her own quietness and other too
