Newcome that you for sooth so much scorn I can find in my heart to pray nine time to the moon and fost three saint Anne eaves so that I may be sure to have he to my husband ay thou will have he dream but not wake I be sure not wake yea and a bed too for here I vow even by the chaste thought that ere be nurse within Diana breast and by those purple drop chaste Lucrece spill and by the unstainde colour of a maiden blush that I will prove as true unto his bed as ere do she that do Ulysses wed nay since I have refuse a lord by this light I scorn to marry any under the degree of a knight no I will not have a knight if I may for there be so many as they be forget what they be nay I then I see you be deceive why woman they have most of they take a order that they will never be forget for they have book themselves down a purpose I know above three and twenty in one mercer book in cheap side then judge thou how many be in all their book and there be that will be a witness I warrant you to after age what their forefather have be ay but that|be but their fault yet you know their calling be honourable though faith thou say true I must needs say knighthood be like marriage know a day

reputation with my new master this time be ill take yet something I must do fellow wage how long have thou be here ever since fortune deny thou wealth all ill upon she but thou have courage to defend her honour 'slight he have hear all why man it|be my master set i only to try she nay like enough for I see he will willing prove a accessary to the steal of his own good true and look here he come but I pray thou say nothing let i tell he of it who I not a word my mouth be as close as a faulconer pouch or a country wench placket she will never cuckold i but that she have some reason for|it true sir there be nothing do but there|be reason for it if a man can find it for what|be the reason your citizen wife continual wear hat but to show the desire they have always to be cover or why do your sempster spend their time in prick and your lady in poke of ruff but only to show they do as they will be do unto or why do your inn of court man lie with his laundress in a long vacation but because he have no money to go abroad or why do your old judge widow always marry young gentleman but to show that they love execution better than judgement o but I wonder much she will not give i leave to make my first child myself foe she know you be but a apprentice to the occupation and common prentice spoil their first work and be unskilful she be loath you shall practise in a good shop and therefore she befriend you because she will have it well do she get a better workman to do it for you for what|be the reason the young brother accord to the old wife tail always prove the wise man but because the father grow more skilful at last than they be at the first but I think your wife elder son will prove a excellent fellow because she have the help of so many in the make of it for common if one have a thing to be do as a conveyance to be draw or a case in the law to be argue a man will have the help of as many good lawyer as he can get now this case of make of child and a case in the law be something like for as one lawyer take his fee and deal in|it another lawyer come and argue the case more profound but in the end when all be do leave it to be try by the jury in who the right be and so must you when they and you and all have do your best yet in the end must leave it to be try by your wife who|be the child be for a woman knowledge in this case be better than twelve man o slack I hate worse than the worst sin that be and I pray which sin do you most hate that which be most like she which if thou will repeat I|will tell their condition and I which be most like she then the first be pride I will have that sin burn for a witch it change man into so many shape the next be murder o that|be a thirsty sin for nought can quench it but blood what be theft faith the great fault that I can find in that be it cozen the scrivener for it borrow money without give any obligation covetousness o that|be a excellent sin for to deal with a that have a loose belly for it|will bind any man for ten groat what be sloth then faith sloth be a good maidenly green-sickness sin but lechery my lady o that|be the suck sin that a man can be acquaint withal it can endure to be in company it creep into corner and hide itself in the dark still what say then to drunkenness o that|be a most gentleman like sin it scorn to be behold for what it receive in a man house it common leave it again at his door nay than lechery scorn to be behold too for I have know what it have receive in a man house it have send home again nine month after and lie at his door and therefore the more gentleman like sin a great deal because it take the long time of repayment but I pray sit now which of all this be most like your wife murder for nought can quench her thirst of lust but now I soon shall find her villainy praise be my vigilant care which if I do espy I|will turn she off Alas alas sir you have no reason to be angry much less to be divorce although she do transgress be you not cut have you not give her cause be it not out of mere necessity she do it therefore if you follow my counsel make her amends with kindness and put not her away believe i he speak wise and good counsel like a lady be to be embrace not put she away and if she wrong he if he do not I say he be one of the arrant block that ever man spurn on why be he not a gentleman a knight have he not see fashion sir I will have you bear a noble mind put she away and you list it|be no matter for cause if she change but a trencher with the groom of your stable it|be deal enough to be divorce therefore put she away and than you may have another wife another wife true a gallant and yet a modest lady too one that shall nourish no blood but your own tender your reputation as the apple of her eye and honour even your very footstep she shall go I|will make she truss up her trinket o faith she shall away shall she away if she do you do you know not what you draw a thousand thousand enemy about your ear her kindred they|will exclaim no friend will seek revenge and your enemy will grow even fat with laughter at your folly beside what woman then will have you be you not geld assure yourself that now there be none will love you most will hate you but all will scorn you therefore by my advice make much of she and keep she while you have she hah now by the virtue of my hear he speak but reason So it|be good to keep she still dwell in the suburb to break down your own glass window set some pick upon your hatch and I pray profess to keep a bawdy-house a bawdy-house no I|will die first and if I see but any apparent show of her disloyalty I|will even be divorce immediate well I see the substance of this slave be villainy but I|will prevent he even what I can since none be worse than a serve honest man
