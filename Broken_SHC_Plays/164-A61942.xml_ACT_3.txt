they try what can be use but sword where man have fall from not respect royalty unto a liberty of offend it what though their number equal you sir and now force by necessity like cut in narrow room they fly upon your face think you rebellion and loyalty be empty name and that in subject heart they give not both and take away the courage shall we believe there be no difference in good and bad no punishment nor no protection forbid it heaven if when great Poland honour safety too hang in dispute we shall not draw our sword why be we ever teach to wear they sir this late commotion in your kingdom sir be like a grow wen upon the face which as we can look on without trouble so take|it away we can without danger war there have foul face and I must fear it where the pretext be fair

lord do think he will fight troth it may be not nature in those fine piece do as painter hang out a pleasant excellence that take the eye which be indeed but a course canvas in the naked truth or some
