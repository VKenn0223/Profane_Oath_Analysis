it the divine virtue of love have disperse themselves through the power of the world so forcible as to make they take by his influence the form and quality impress within they no doubt they can not choose but favour more of his divinity I do not think love have any spark of divinity in he since the end or his be be earthly in the blood be he beget by the frail fire of the eye and quench by the frail shadow of thought what reason have we then to soothe his humour with such zeal and follow his fade delight with such passion we have body Silvestris and humane body which in their own nature be much more wretched than beast and much more miserable than beast pursue their own ruin and since it will ask long labour and study to subdue the power of our blood to the rule of the soul than to satisfy they with the fruition of our love let we be constant in the world error and seek our own torment as good yield indeed submissive and satisfy part of our affection as be stubborn without ability to resist and enjoy none of they I be in worst plight since I love a nymph that mock love and I one that hate love ay one that think herself above love let we not dispute who mistress be most bad since they be all cruel nor which of our fortune be most froward since they be all desperate I will hang my scutcheon on this tree in honour of Ceres and write this verse on the tree in hope of my
