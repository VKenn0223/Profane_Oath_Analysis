accost he it|be great pity that such as sit at the helm provide no better for the training up of the gentry in my judgement a academy erect with large pension to such as in a table can set down the congee cringe posture method phrase proper to every nation o it be a admirable piece of work and yet rich fool throw away their charity on hospital for beggar and lame soldier and never study the due regard to compliment and courtship matter of more import and be indeed the glory of a monarchy these no doubt be state point gallant I confess but sure our court need no aid this way since it be a school of nothing else there be some of you who I for bear to name who coin head be the mint of all new fashion that have do more hurt to the kingdom by superfluous bravery which the foolish gentry
