lady I doubt whether there be any colour so fresh that may shadow a countenance so fair sir I have think you have be command to paint with your hand not to gloze with your tongue but as I have hear it

i answer non lubet esse domi it be always my master fashion when any fair gentlewoman be to be draw within to make i to stay without but if he shall paint jupiter like a bull like a swan like a eagle then must Psyllus with one hand grind colour and with the other hold the candle but let he alone the better he shadow her face the more will he burn his own heart and now if a man can mere with mane who I dare say look as lean as if Diogenes drop out of his nose and here come mane who have as much meat in his maw as thou have honesty in thy head then I hope thou be very hungry they that know thou

great girder call it a short say of a sharp wit with a bitter sense in a sweet word how can thou thus divine divide define dispute and all on the sudden wit will have his swing I be bewitch inspire inflame infect well then will not I tempt thy gibe spirit do not Psyllus for thy dull head will be but a grindstone for my quick wit which if thou whet with overthwart peristi actum est de te I have draw blood at one brain with a bitter bob let i cross myself for I die if I cross thou let i do my business I myself be afraid lest my wit shall wax warm and then must it needs consume some hard head with fine and pretty jest I be sometime in such a vain that for want of some dull pate to work on I begin to gird myself the god shield i from such a fine fellow who word melt wit like wax well then let we to the matter in faith my master mean tomorrow to fly it be a jest be it a jest to fly shall thou fly so soon thou shall repent it in earnest well I will be the crier o be o be o be all manner of man woman or child that will come to morrow into the market place between the hour of nine and ten shall see Diogenes the cynic fly I do not think he will fly tush say fly fly now let we go for I will not see he again till midnight I have a back way into his tub which way call thou the backway when every way be open I mean to come in at his back well let we go away that we may return speedy I shall never draw your eye well because they blind i why then paint i without eye for I be blind be you ever shadow before of any no and will you can so now shadow i that I may not be perceive of any it be pity but that so absolute a face shall furnish Venus temple among these picture what be these picture this be Leda who jove deceive in likeness of a swan a fair woman but a foul deceit this be Alcmene unto who jupiter come in shape of Amphitrion her husband and beget Hercules a famous son but a infamous fact he may do it because he be a God nay therefore it be evil do because he be a God this be Danae into who prison jupiter drizzle a golden shower and obtain his desire what gold can make one yield to desire this be Europa who jupiter ravish this Antiopa be all the god like this jupiter there be many god in this like jupiter I think in those day love be well ratify among man on earth when lust be so full authorize by the god in heaven nay you may imagine there be woman pass amiable when there be god exceed amorous Were woman never so fair man will be false Were woman never so false man will be fond what counterfeit be this Apelles this be Venus the goddess of love what be there also love goddess this be she that have power to command the very affection of the heart how be she hire by prayer by sacrifice or bribe by prayer sacrifice and bribe what prayer vow irrevocable what sacrifice heart ever sigh never dissemble what bribe rose and kiss but be you never in love no nor love in i then have you injury many how so because you have be love of many flatter perchance of some be it not possible that a face so fair and a wit so sharp both without comparison shall not be apt to love if you begin to tip your tongue with cunning I pray dip your pencil in colour and fall to that you must do not that you will do Parmenio I can tell how it come to pass that in Alexander now a day there grow a unpatient kind of life in the morning he be melancholy at noon solemn at all time either more sour or severe than he be accustom in king cause I rather love to doubt then conjecture and think it better to be ignorant then inquisitive they have long ear and stretch arm in who head suspicion be a proof and to be accuse be to be condemn yet between we there can be no danger to find out the cause for that there be no malice to withstand it it may be a unquenchable thirst of conquer make he unquiet it be not unlikely his long ease have alter his humour that he shall be in love it be not impossible in love Clytus no no it be as far from his thought as treason in we he who ever wake eye who never tire heart who body patient of labour who mind unsatiable of victory have always be note can so soon be melt into the weak conceit of love Aristotle tell he there be many world and that he have not conquer one that gape for all gall Alexander but here he come Parmenio and Clitus I will have you both ready to go into Persia about a ambassage no less profitable to i than to yourselves honourable we be ready at all command wish nothing else but continual to be command well then withdraw yourselves till I have further consider of this matter now we will see how Apelles go forward I doubt i that nature have overcome art and her countenance his cunning you love and therefore think any thing but not so far in love with Campaspe as with Bucephalus if occasion serve either of conflict or of conquest occasion can want if will do not behold all Persia swell in the pride of their own power the scythian careless what courage or fortune can do the egyptian dream in the soothsay of their augur and gape over the sinoak of their beast entrails all these Alexander be to be subdue if that world be not slip out of your head which you have swear to conquer with that hand I confess the labour fit for Alexander and yet recreation necessary among so many assault bloody wound intolerable trouble give i leave a little if not to sit yet to breath and doubt not but Alexander can when he will throw affection as far from he as he can cowardice but behold Diogenes talk with one at his tub one penny Diogenes I be a cynic he make thou a beggar that first give thou any thing why if thou will give nothing nobody will give thou I want nothing till the spring dry and the earth perish I gather for the god and I care not for those god which want money thou be a right cynic that will give nothing thou be not that will beg anything Alexander king Alexander give a poor cynic a groat it be not for a king to give a groat then give i a talon it be not for a beggar to ask a talon away Apelles here now gentlewoman do not your beauty put the painter to his trump yes my lord see so disorder a countenance he fear he shall shadow a deform counterfeit will he can colour the life with the feature and methinks Apelles be you as cunning as report say you be you may paint flower aswell with sweet smell as fresh colour observe in your mixture such thing as shall draw near to their savour your majesty must know it be no less hard to paint savour then virtue colour can neither speak nor think where do you first begin when you draw any picture the proportion of the face in just compass as I can I will begin with the eye as a light to all the rest if you will paint as you be a king your majesty may begin where you please but as you will be a painter you must begin with the face Aurelius will in one hour colour four face I marvel in half a hour he do not four why be it so easy no but he do it so homely when will you finish Campaspe never finish for always in absolute beauty there be somewhat above art why shall not I by labour be as cunning as Apelles God shield you shall have cause to be so cunning as Apelles methinks four colour be sufficient to shadow any countenance and so it be in the time of Phydias then have man few fancy and woman not so many favor for now if the hair of her eye brow be black yet must the hair of her head be yellow the attire of her head must be different from the habit of her body else will the picture seem like the blazon of ancient armoury not like the sweet delight of new find amiableness for as in garden knot diversity of odour make a more sweet savour or as in music diverse string cause a more delicate consent so in paint the more colour the better counterfeit observe black for a ground and the rest for grace lend i thy pencil Apelles I will paint and thou shall judge here the coal break you lean too hard now it black not you lean too soft this be awry your eye go not with your hand now it be worse your hand go not with your mind nay if all be too hard or soft so many rule and regard that one hand one eye one mind must all draw together I have rather be set of a battle then blot of a board but how have I do here like a king I think so but nothing more unlike a painter well Apelles Campaspe be finish as I wish dismiss she and bring present she counterfeit after i I will now Hephestion do not this matter cotton as I will Campaspe look pleasant liberty will increase her beauty and my love shall advance her honour I will not contrary your majesty for time must wear out that love have wrought and reason wean what appetite nurse how stately she pass by yet how sober a sweet consent in her countenance with a chaste disdain desire mingle with coyness and I can tell how to term it a curse yield modesty let she pass so she shall for the fair on the earth I shall|be hang for tarry so long I pray God my master be not fly before I come away Manes my master do come where have you be all this while nowhere but here who be here sithence my come nobody ungracious wag I perceive you have be a loiter be Alexander nobody he be a king I mean no mean body I will cudgel your body for it and then will I say it be nobody because it be no honest body away in unfortunate Apelles and therefore unfortunate because Apelles have thou by draw her beauty bring to pass that thou can scarce draw thy own breath and by so much the more have thou increase thy care by how much the more thou have show thy cunning be it not sufficient to behold the fire and warm thou but with Satyrus thou must kiss the fire and burn thou o Campaspe Campaspe art must yield to nature reason to appetite wisdom to affection can Pygmalion entreat by prayer to have his ivory turn into flesh and can Apelles obtain by plaint to have the picture of his love change to life be paint so far inferior to carve or do thou Venus more delight to be hew with chisel then shadow with colour what Pigmalion or what Pyrgoteles or what Lysippus be he that ever make thy face so fair or spread thy fame so far as I unless Venus in this thou envy my art that in colour my sweet Campaspe I have leave no place by cunning to make thou so amiable but alas she be the paramour to a prince Alexander the monarch of the earth have both her body and affection for what be it that king can obtain by prayer threat and promise will not she think it better to sit under a cloth of estate like a queen than in a poor shop like a huswife and esteem it sweet to be the concubine of the lord of the world than spouse to a painter in Athens yes yes Apelles thou may swim against the stream with the crab and feed against the wind with the dear and peck against the steel with the cockatrice star be to be look at not reach at prince to be yield unto not contend with Campaspe to be honour not obtain to be paint not possess of thou oh fair face oh unhappy hand and why do thou draw it so fair a face o beautiful countenance the express image of Venus but somewhat fresh the only pattern of that eternity which jupiter dream of asleep can not conceive again wake blush Venus for I be ashamed to end thou now must I paint thing unpossible for my art but agreeable with my affection deep and hollow sigh sad and melancholy thought wound and slaughter of conceit a life post to death a death gallop from life a waver constancy a unsettle resolution and what not Apelles and what but Apelles but as they that be shake with a fever be to be warm with clothes not groan and as he that melt in a consumption be to be recure by colices not conceit so the feed canker of my care the never die worm of my heart be to be kill by counsel not cry by apply of remedy not by reply of reason and sith in case desperate there must be use medicine that be extreme I will hazard that little life that be leave to restore the great part that be lose and this shall|be my first practice for wit must work where authority be not assoon as Alexander have view this portraiture I will by devise give it a blemish that by that mean she may come again to my shop and then as good it be to utter my love and die with denial as conceal it and live in despair
