great duke know of my arrival I haste my lord here I|will attend his come and see you keep yourself as much as may be conceal from all man else to serve your lordship I wish I be invisible I be drive into a desperate straight and can steer a middle course and of the two extreme which I must make election of I know not which be more full of horror never servant stand more engage to a magnificent master than I to Cozimo and all those honour and glory by his grace confer upon i or by my prosperous service deserve if now I shall deceive his trust and make a shipwreck of my loyalty be ruine and on the other side if I discover Lydia divine perfection all my hope in she be sink never to be buoy up for it|be impossible but assoon as see she must with adoration be sue to a hermit at his bead but look on she or the cold cynic who corinthian Lais not move with her lust blandishment call a stone at this object will take fire nor be the duke such a Hippolytus but that this Phaedra but see must force he to forsake the grove and Diane huntsmanship proud to serve under Venus soft ensign no there be no way for i to hope fruition of my end but to conceal her beauty and how that may be effect be as hard a task as with a veil to cover the sun beam or comfortable light three year the prince live in her company and Contarino the secretary have possess the duke what a rare piece she be but he|be my creature and may with ease be fright to deny what he have say and if my long experience with some strong reason I have think upon can overreach a youth my practice yield i but little profit you be well return sir leave we when that your grace shall know the motive that force i to invite you to this trouble you will excuse my manner sir there need not this circumstance between we you be ever my

I pawn my honour which be the best security I can give yet it shall not be discover this assurance be more than I with modesty can demand from such a paymaster but I must be sudden and therefore to the purpose can your excellence in your imagination conceive on what design or whither the duke will command i hence last night no I assure you and it have be a rudeness to inquire of that I be not call to grant i hear and I will make you true understand it only do concern you i my lord you in your present state and future fortune for both lie at the stake you much amaze i pray you resolve this riddle you know the duke if he die issueless as yet he be determine you his heir it have please his highness oft to profess so much but say he shall be win to prove a second wife on who he may beget a son how in a moment will all those glorious expectation which render you reverence and remarkable be in a moment blast however you be his much love sister son I must bear it with patience and in i it be a duty that I be bear with and it|be much unfit for the receiver of a benefit to offer for his own end to prescribe law to the giver pleasure sweet answer and like your noble self this your rare temper so win upon i that I will not live if that by honest art I can prevent it to see your hope make frustrate and but think how you shall be transform from what you be shall this as heaven avert it ever happen it must disturb your peace for whereas now be as you be receive for the heir apparent you be no soon see but wonder at the signior make it a business to inquire how you have sleep and as
