make thyself less Philotas than thou be what mean my father thus to write to i less than I be in what how can that be must I be then set underneath my heart shall I let go the hold I have of grace gain with so hard adventure of my blood and suffer other mount into my place and from below look up to where I stand shall I degrade the|opinion of my worth by put off employment as undo in spirit or grace while other man set forth to get that start of action I have win as if such man as I have any place to stay betwixt their ruin and their grace can any go beyond i but they will go over i and trample on my state and make their fortune good upon my ill while fear have power to wound i worse than hate Philotas you deceive yourself in this your father mean not you shall yield in place but in your popular dependence your entertainment guife and public grace that do in jealous king distaste the peer and make you not the great but in fear alas what popular dependence do I retain can I shake off the zeal of such as do out of their kindness follow my fortune in the commonweal Indeed Philotas therein you say true they follow do your fortune and not you yea but I find their love to i sincere Even such as to the wolf the fox do bear that visit he but to partake his prey and see his hope deceive turn to betray I know they will if I in danger stand run unto i with hazard of their blood yea like as man to burn house run not to lend aid but to be looker on but I with bounty and with gift have tie their heart so sure I know they will not slide bounty and gift lose more than they do find where many look for good few have their mind each think he merit more than than he have and so gift lay for love do catch man wrath but many mere out of love attend yea those that love and have no other end think you that man can love you when they know you have they not for friendship but for show and as you be engage in your affair and have your end think likewise they have they but I do true from my heart affect virtue and worth where I do find it set beside my foe do force i in effect to make my party of opinion great and I must arm i thus against their scorn man must be shod that go among the thorn ah good Philotas you yourself be guile it|be not the way to quench the fire with oil the meek and humble lamb with small ado suck his own dam we see and other too in court man long live and keep their rank by take injury and give thanks and be it so then never be these hair like to attain that sober hue of grey I can plaster and disguise my|affair in other colour then my heart do lay nor can I patient endure this fond and strange proceed of authority that have engross up all into their hand by idolize feeble majesty and impious do labour all they can to make the king forget he be a man while they divide the spoil and pray of power and none at all respect the public good those hand that guard and get we what be our the soldiery engage to vent their blood in worse case seem then Pallas old-grown moil the athenian foster at their public cost for these poor soul consume with tedious toil remain neglect have do their most and nothing shall bring home of all these war but empty age and body charge with scar Philotas all this public care I fear be but some private touch of your dislike who see your own design not stand to square with your desire no other course like the grief you take thing be not order well be that you feel yourself I fear not well but when your fortune shall stand parallel with those you envy now all will be well for you great man I see be never more your end attain the same you be before you with a finger can point out the stain of other error now and now condemn the train of state while your desire remain without but once get in you jump with they and interleague you with iniquity and with a like neglect do temporize and only serve your own commodity your fortune then view thing with other eye for either greatness do transform the heart into other shape of thought or certain this vulgar honesty do dwell apart from power and be some private quality or rather those fair part which we esteem in such as you be not the same they seem you double with yourselves or else with we and therefore now Philotas even as good to|embrace the time as swell and do no good Alas Chalisthenes you have not lay true level to my nature but be wide from what I be within all you have say shall never make i of another side then that I be and I do scorn to climb by shake hand with this unworthy time the time Philotas then will break thy neck they dare nor friend my faith will keep my neck my service to the state have caution so sure for my honour as it shall make good the place my deed have purchase with danger in the love and heart of all those service will serve as weight to charge and press you unto death if your foot fail never so little underneath your charge and will be deem donne for your own avail and who have spirit to do the great good may do most hurt if they remain not good tush they can want my service in the state these time want not man to supply the state I fear not while parmenio force stand water far off quench not fire near hand you may be fair dispatch ere he can hear or if he hear before he can be here and therefore do not build upon such sand it will deceive your hope when all be do for though you be the minion of the land if you break out be sure you be undo when run with the current of the state be you the weak man of man alive and in convention and in counsel sit and do but sleep or nod yet shall you thrive these motive spirit be never fit to rise and it|be a danger to be hold so wise what call you run with the slate shall I combine with those that do abuse the slate who want of judgement wit and honesty I be ashamed to see and see hate tush tush my lord think not of what be fit the world be govern more by form than wit he that will fret at lord and at the rain be but a fool

gallant man Persia or Greece or all the world can see thou who be entertain and grace by all the flower of honour else do not despise that unto i poor captive shall befall so great a grace in such a worthy eye I envy not thy love but think thou bless to|enjoy he in that sort but tell i true do thou ever prove whether he love in earnest or in sport let I|a little glory in my grace out of the passion of the joy I feel and tell thou a secret but in any case as you|be a woman do not it reveal one day as I be fit all alone in come Philotas from a victory all blood and dust yet jolly have win the glory of the day most gallant And warm with honour of his good success relate to i the danger he be in whereat I wonder blame his forwardness faith wench say he thus must we fight toil win to make that youngman proud thus be he bear upon the wing of our desert our blood set he above himself and make he scorn his own his country and the author of his good my father be the first that out from Greece show he the way of Asia set he on and by his project raise the great piece of this proud work which now he tread upon Parmenio without Alexander much have wrought without Parmenio Alexander have do nought but let he use his fortune while he may time have their change we must not still be lead and sweet Antigona thou may one day yet bless the hour to|have know Philotas bed wherewith he

these conquer eye affection in his high-built heart to|have move yet never can for what my labour seek I see be lose upon vain ignorance while he that be the glory of the greek virtue upholder honour countenance out of this garnish of his worthy part be fall upon this foolish persian to who his secret grave he impart which she as wise keep and govern can it|be strange to see the humour of these man these great aspire spirit that shall be wise we woman shall know all for now and then out of the humour of their jollity the smoke of their ambition must have vent and out it come what rack shall not reveal for this her humour have so much of wind that it will burst itself if too close pen and none more fit than we their wisdom find who will for love or want of wit conceal for be the nature of great spirit to love to be where they may be most eminent and rate of themselves so far above we in conceit with who they do frequent imagine how we wonder and esteem all that they do or say which make they strive to make our admiration more extreme which they suppose they can less they give notice of their extreme and high thought and then the|opinion that we love they too beggar a confidence of secrecy whereby whatever they intend to do we shall be sure to know it present but faith I scorn that such a one as she a silly witted wench shall have this grace to be prefer and honour before i have but only beauty and a face I that be ever court by the great and gallant peer and prince of the east who Alexander in the great state the earth do ever see he make his guest there where this tongue obtain for her merit eternity of fame there where these hand do write in fire the glory of my spirit and set a trophy that for ever stand Thais action with the grecian act shall|be enregister alike Thaeis she that fire the stately palace the|earth do ever see Darius house that to the cloud aspire she be put back behind Antigona but soon Philotas shall his error see who think that beauty best man passion fit for that they use our body not our wit and unto Craterus will I present and he acquaint with all this who discourse who I be sure will take it well of we for these great minion who with envious eye look on each other greatness will be glad in such a case of this importancy to have the|advantage that may here be have we as the chorus of the vulgar stand spectator here to see these great man play their part both of obedience and command and censure all they do and all they say for though we be esteem but ignorant yet be we capable of truth and know where they do well and where their action want the grace that make they prove the best in show and though we know not what they do within where they attire their mystery of state yet know we by the|event what plot have be and how they all without do personate we see who well a mean part become fail in a great and disgrace the same we see some worthy of advancement deem save when they have it some again have get good reputation and be well esteem in place of greatness which before be not we see affliction act a better scene then prosperous fortune which have mar it clean we see that all which we have praise in some have only be their fortune not desert some war have grace who peace do ill become and lustful ease have blemish all their part we see Philotas act his goodness ill and make his passion to report of he worse than he be and we do fear he will bring his free nature to be|entrap by they for sure there be some engine close lay against his grace and greatness with the king and that unless his humour prove more stay we soon shall see his utter ruine and his affliction our compassion draw which still look on man fortune not the cause
