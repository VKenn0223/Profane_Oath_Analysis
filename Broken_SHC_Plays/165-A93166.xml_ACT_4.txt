Fernando love thou he be a gentleman confirm in all that|be honourable and can forget who his own virtue have make choice to shine upon unless my innocence apt to believe a flatter tongue see not the serpent couch and hide his speckle breast among the flower but it be sin to think he can dissemble father and I know not since I be first the object of his charity I find a pious gratitude disperse within my soul and every thought of he engender a warm sigh within i which like curl of holy incense overtake each other in my bosom and enlarge with their embrace his sweet remembrance cherish those thought and where such noble worth invite be bold to call it love it be too much ambition to hope he shall be just to i or keep his honour when I look on the pale complexion of my want and yet unless

you have not cast your bounty on a rock while the seed thrive where you do place your charity my joy may seem ill dress to come like sorrow thus but you may see through every tear and find my eye mean innocence and your hearty welcome who do prepare thou Felisarda thus to entertain i weep sure our soul meet and converse and we not know|it there be such beauty in that watery circle I be fearful to come near and breathe a kiss upon thy cheek lest I pollute that crystal and yet I must salute thou and I dare with one warm sigh meet and dry up this sorrow I shall forget all misery for when I look upon the world and race of man I find they proud and all so unacquainted with pity to such miserable thing as poverty have make we that I must conclude you send from heaven o do not flatter thyself poor Felisarda I|be mortal the life I bear about i be not i but borrow to come to thou once again and ere I go to clear how much I love thou but first I have a story to deliver a tale will make thou

go that in the morning promise many year but death have in few hour make he as stiff as all the wind and winter have throw cold upon he and whisper he to marble now trust i my heart weep for he but I understand not how I be concern in his displeasure and in such height as you profess he do command i on his blessing to forsake thou be|it not a cruel precept to enforce the soul and curse his son for honest love this be a wound indeed but not so mortal for his last breath be balsom pour upon it by which he do reverse his malediction and I that groan beneath the weight of that anathema sink almost to despair where night and heavy shade hang round about i find myself rise like the morning star to view the world never I hope to be eclipse again this be a welcome blessing heaven have a care of both my joy be mighty vouchsafe i sir your pardon if I blush and say I love but rather than the peace that shall preserve your bosom suffer for my sake it|be better I be dead no live and live for ever happy thou deservede it it be Fernando do make haste to sleep in his forget dust those accent do not sound so cheerful do love i sir do not I prithee do not I be lose alas I be no more Fernando there be nothing but the empty name of he that do betray thou place a guard about thy heart be time I be not worth this sweetness do not Fernando speak all this alas he know that I be poor before and need not despise i now for that desert i goodness when I upbraid thy want it|be I be poor for I have not a stock in all the world of so much dust as will contrive one narrow cabin to shroud a worm my die father have give away my birthright to Francisco I|be disinherit throw out of all but the small earth I borrow thus to walk on and have nothing leave I come to kiss thou and take my everlasting leave of thou too farewell this will persuade thou to consent to my eternal absence I must beseech you stay a little sir and clear my faith have your displease father deprive you then of all and make Francisco the lord of your inheritance without hope to be repair in fortune it|be sad truth this be a happiness I do not look for a happiness yes sir a happiness can Felisarda take delight to hear what have undo her servant heaven avert it but it|be not worth my grief to be assure that this will bring i near now to he who I most honour of the world and it|be my pride if you exceed i not in fortune that I can boast my heart as high and rich with noble flame and every way your equal and if you be as poor as I Fernando I can deserve you now and love you more than when your expectation carry all the pride and blossom of the spring upon it those shadow will not feed more than our fancy two poverty will keep but a thin table and while we dream of this high nourishment we do but starve more glorious it|be ease and wealth first teach we art to surfeit by nature be wise not costly and will spread a table for we in the wilderness and the kind earth keep we alive and healthful with what her bosom do invite we to the brook not there suspect as the wine that sometime prince quaff be all transparent and with their pretty murmur call to taste they in every tree a chorister to sing health to our love our life shall there be free as the first knowledge be from sin and all our dream as innocent o Felisarda if thou do own less virtue I may prove unkind and marry thou but be so rich in goodness it become i not to bring one that be poor in every worth to waste so excellent a dower be free and meet one that have wealth to cherish it I shall undo thou quite but pray for i as I that thou may change for a more happy bridegroom I dare as soon be guilty of my death as make thou miserable by expect i farewell and do not wrong my soul to think that any storm can separate we two but that I have no fortune now to serve thou this will be no exception sir I hope when we be both dead yet our body may be cold and stranger in the wind sheet we shall be marry when our spirit meet
