in his name and honour see his murder body warm and pant with the labour of his spirit till my amaze soul shrink and hide itself while barbarous Columbo grin stand and mock the weep wound it be too much that you shall keep your heart alive so long after this spectacle and not revenge it you do not know the business of my heart that censure i so rash yet I thank you and if you be Alvarez friend dare tell your confidence that I despise my life but know not how to use it in a service to speak i his revenger this will need no other proof than that to you who may be send with cunning to betray i I have make this bold confession I so much desire to sacrifice to that hover ghost Columbo life that I be not ambitious to keep my own two minute after it if you will call i coward which be equal to think I be a traitor I forgive it for this brave resolution which time and all the destiny must aid I beg that I may kiss your hand for this and may the soul of angry honour guide it whither to don Columbo heart it be too weak I fear alone alone be you in earnest why will it not be a dishonour to your justice madam another arm shall interpose but that it be a saucy act to mingle with you I dare nay I be bind in the revenge of he that|be dead since the whole world have interest in every goodman loss to offer it dare you command i madam not command but I shall more than honour such a truth in man that dare against so mighty odds appear Alvarez friend and i the cardinal be for the second course Columbo must be first cut up his ghost must lead the dance let he die first but how how with a sword and if I undertake it I will lose so much of my own honour to kill he base how shall I reward this infinite service it|be not modesty while now my husband groan beneath his tomb and call i to his marble bed to promise what this great act may well deserve myself if you survive the victor but if thus Alvarez ash be appease it must deserve a honourable memory and though Columbo as he have all power and grasp the fate have vow to kill the man that shall succeed Alvarez tyranny yet if ever I entertain a thought of love hereafter Hernando from the world shall challenge it till when my prayer and fortune shall wait on you this be too mighty recompense it|be all just if I outlive Columbo I must not expect security at home thou can not fly where all my fortune and my love shall not attend to guard thou if I die thy memory shall have a shrine the next within my heart to my Alvarez once again your hand your cause be so religious you need not strengthen it with your prayer trust it to i madam the cardinal will you appear and he have all the horror of the devil in|his face I will not balk he what make Hernando here I do not like they shall consult I|will take no note the king fair salute your grace by who command I be to tell you though his will and action illimited stoop not to satisfy the vulgar inquisition he be yet willing to retain a just opinion with those that be place near he and although you look with nature eye upon yourself which need no perspective to reach nor art of any optic to make great what your narrow sense apply a injury our self still near to ourselves but there|be another eye that look abroad and walk in search of reason and the weight of thing with which if you look on he you will find his pardon to Columbo can be so much against his justice as your err faith will persuade your anger good my lord your phrase have too much landscape and I can distinguish at this distance you present the figure perfect but indeed my eye may pray your lordship find excuse for tear have almost make they blind fair peace restore they to bring the object near the king say he can not be severe to don Columbo without injustice to his other merit which call more loud for their reward and honour than you for your revenge the kingdom make happy by those you only by the last unfortunate nor be it rational I speak the king own language he shall die for take one man breath without who valour none now have be alive without dishonour in my poor understanding it|be the crown of virtue to proceed in its own tract not deviate from honour if you acquit a man of murder because he have do brave thing in the war you will bring down his valour to a crime nay to a bawd if it secure a rape and but teach those that deserve well to sin with great licence but dispute be now too late my lord it|be do and you by the good king in tender of my sorrow send to persuade i it|be unreasonable that justice shall repair i you mistake for if Columbo death can make Alvarez live the king have give he up to law your bleed sacrifice but when his life be but another treasure throw away to obey a clamorous statute it be wisdom to himself and common safety to take off this kill edge of law and keep Columbo to recompense the crime by noble act and sorrow that in time may draw your pity this be a great tyranny than that Columbo exercise he kill my lord and you not have the charity to let i think it worth a punishment to that in my own name I answer I condemn and urge the bloody guilt against my nephew it|be violent and cruel a black deed a deed who memory do make i shudder a act that do betray a tyrannous nature which he take up in war the school of vengeance and though the king compassion spare he here unless his heart weep itself out in penitent tear this sound as you be now a good man do your grace think I have conscience to allow the murder although when it be do I do obey the stream of nature as he be my kinsman to plead he may not pay his forfeit life can I do less for one so near my blood Consider madam and be charitable let not this wild injustice make i lose the character I bear and reverend habit to make you full acquaint with my innocence I challenge here my soul and heaven to witness if I have any thought or knowledge with my nephew plot or person when he come under the smooth pretence of friend to violate your hospitable law and do that act who frequent mention draw this tear a whirlwind snatch i to endless flame I must believe and ask your grace pardon I confess I have not love you since Alvarez death though we be reconcile I do not blame your jealousy nor any zeal you have to prosecute revenge against i madam as I then stand suspect nor can yet implore your mercy to Columbo all I have to say be to retain my first opinion and credit with your grace which you may think I urge not out of fear or end upon you since I thank the king I stand firm on the base of royal favour but for your own sake and to show I have compassion of your suffering you have clear a doubt my lord and by this fair remonstrance give my sorrow so much truce to think that we may meet again and yet be friend but be not angry if I still remember by who Alvarez die and weep and wake another justice with my prayer all thought that may advance a better peace dwell with you how will this cozen statesman bribe my faith with flattery to think he innocent no if his nephew die this cardinal must not be long-lived all the prayer of a wrong widow make firm Hernando sword and my own hand shall have some glory in the next revenge I will
