shame and dishonour to the roman name a triumph hold at Alexandria only to honour Cleopatra pride ah Marcus this egyptian queen be make to be the ruin of Antonius how can you jest Canidius on a theme so sad how Plancus can you prophecy so sad on so merry a occasion as be the love of lady let Canidius have his own way Munatius it|be in vain to talk to he will you can let i have Antonius his way upon condition I suffer you to censure grave of it and prophesy my ruin but my lord you be as good be merry too and take your share of pleasure in the|aegyptian court you|will do no good with these persuasion he love the queen and will do so in spite of our morality it|be too too true that face of she that beauty in the bud not full blow in year of innocence if any year of she be innocent set off with no adulterism of art nor clothe with state and pompous majesty but in a fortune cloud and distress a wretched prisoner in her brother court yet then I say that charm face can move the manly temper of wise Julius Caesar that mar in heat of all his active war when he pursue the fly Pompey hither his sword yet reek in Pharsalus slaughter at sight of she become a dote lover and can we think that our Antonius a man not master of that temperance that Caesar have can find a strength to guard his soul against that beauty now set off with so much wealth and majesty no sure I do not think Antonius be a eunuch nor can I have believe he have be worthy to be a successor in Caesar power unless he have succeed he in she great Julius noble act in war and state assure the world that he be wise and valiant but if he have not fall in love with she I shall have much suspect his good nature or what indeed be greatness in the world if he that do possess it may not play the wanton with it this egyptian queen be a state beauty and ordain by fate to be possess by they that rule the world great Pompey son enjoy her first and pluck her virgin blossom when that family Plutarch who ruin fill the world be overthrow great Julius next come in as conqueror to have his share and as he do in power succeed he in Cleopatra love now our Antonius take his turn and think that all the legion all the sword that come to make his greatness up when Julius die can give no great privilege to he then power to be the servant to this queen thus whosoever in Rome be conqueror his laurel wreath be Cleopatra love and to speak just of she nature teem to build this woman for no mean height her soul be full of greatness and her wit have charm as many as her beauty have with majesty beyond her sex she rule her spacious kingdom and all neighbour prince admire her part how many language speak she with elegance ambassador from the aethiopian Arab troglodyte Plut. from the hebrew syrian Mede and parthian have in amazement hear this learned queen without the aid of a interpreter in all their several tongue return their answer when most of her dull predecessor king since Ptolemaeus Philadelphus time scarce understand the egyptian tongue and some have quite forget the macedonian I|will lay my life it please he the man be deep in love and pity it|be he have so great a rival as Antonius well use your wit upon i but I doubt if any man can search your secret thought it|be envy not morality that make you tax his love how grave ere you talk but can Canidius think it shall be just in our Antonius to forsake for she his lawful wife the good Octavia then like a Roman let i answer Marcus be it become a care worthy of we what woman Antony enjoy have we time to dispute his matrimonial fault that have already see the breach of all Rome sacred law by which the world be bind have we endure our consul state and power to be subject by the lawless arm of private man or senator proscribe and can we now consider whether they that do all this may keep a wench or no it be the crime of we and fate itself that Antony and Caesar can usurp a power so great beyond which we can suffer no more worth think of nor be|it to we any great fortune if Antonius be honest of his body have we then who have be great magistrate quite lose all show of liberty and now not dare to counsel he a show of liberty when we have lose the substance be best keep by seem not to understand those fault which we want power to mend for my own part I love the person of Antonius and through his great looseness can discern a nature here honest than Caesar and if a war do grow betwixt they as sure ambition will ere long find out a cause although Octavia have not be neglect rather than Rome shall still obey two lord can wish that all be Anthony alone who will I think be bring more easy than Caesar to resign the government will I can think that either will do so here come her servant Mardio enter Mardio noble lord the queen by i entreat your company at supper with the lord Antonius Mardio return our humble service we|will instant attend she now my friend can you a while put off austerity and rigid censure to be free merry I have enough in readiness or else it|will be too late to think on|it now the queen be upon entrance Charmio be thou sure those taper stand just as the queen command it|be the same order that Antonius when last he feast here so much admire and say amongst all the curiosity Plutarch that he have see the place of those light do not the least affect he though the roman in power and warlike state exceed we far yet in our court of Egypt they may learn pleasure and bravery but be thou sure that all thing here be well as exquisite as the queen wish will have it hark they come to say my lord that you be welcome hither be to disparage you who have the power to make yourself so whatever you see in Egypt be your own what Egypt hold if I be judge not all the world beside can equalise will|it please you take your place and these your noble roman friend father Achoreus sit you near to i your holy order and great age which show the god have love you well may just challenge a reverence from we great Julius Caesar do love my father well he oft be please at hour of leisure to confer with he about the nature of our Nile of all the mystery of religion and the wonder that Egypt breed he have a know soul and be a master of philosophy as well as war how like the spangle sky these taper make the high-arched roof to show while Cleopatra like bright Cynthia in her full orb more guild the cheerful night she|be still at full yet still methinks she vex and grow more fair and more majestical my lord you roman who victorious arm have make you master of the world possess such full and high delight in Italy that our poor Egypt can present no pleasure worth your acceptance but let i entreat you will be free merry and forgive your entertainment it|be a entertainment that may invite and please the god methinks Jove shall descend while Cleopatra here disguise for love as once for fear he be when bold Typheous scale the starry sky and all the god disguise in Egypt lurk love

Anthony this compliment so far transcend it leave no answer for a wit so dull as i not he that know how to acquire but to enjoy be bless nor do our happiness consist in motion but in rest the god pass man in bliss because they toil not for more height but can enjoy and in their own eternal rest delight then prince do not toil nor care enjoy what you possess which while you do you equalise the god in happiness Minutius Plancus I be think now how Hannibal be charm at Capua when that delicious place have mollify his rough and cruel soul and make he learn the lesson of soft love and luxury there be no cause Marcus for such a thought for our Antonius in the heat of all his active life know how to revel well let this soft music cease and loud sound this second course be i call in Lucilius fair Cleopatra for addition Plutarch to what thou hold the world-command Rome present these crown and by my hand invest thou Cleopatra queen of wealthy Cyprus of Coelosyria and Phoenicia blush not my love nor let Rome bounty force thy modesty these crown from thy fair brow receive more lustre than they can bestow no Marcus no alas these petty kingdom though too too great to be so ill bestow be not the scope of her ambitious aim my lord I dare not make excuse or plead unworthiness where once Antonius wisdom have make election to confer his favour Admire not friend the godlike power of Rome be more declare by what it give away Plutarch then what it hold but these be still our own and Cleopatra Rome deserve friend I can choose but think how fit a state for Cleopatra Cyprus kingdom be and shall believe that it be ominous that noble Julius Caesar after all those four rich triumph which he hold at Rome when he resolve with like magnificence to build a temple to the goddess Venus from who his house derive their pedigree within his stately temple to express the image of that goddess he set up fair Cleopatra figure in the place suppose she to be the queen of love you know my lord Antonius this be true and Cyprus ever be fair Venus I|will drink it to i Canidius and I thank thou let it go round my friend I ever think myself much bind to brave Canidius since I be happy in his company how fit it be no other cyprian queen but Cleopatra shall the poet know who fancy now shall raise that kingdom high more amorous now will Paphos mountain show and all those flowery mead the field of love over which no wind but western ever blow the air itself will yield a sweet breath while Cleopatra reign the cyprian queen the time I fear Minutius will require a rough language short we shall hear assoon as any news can come from Rome but long ago be I enforce to know that Cleopatra be the queen of love when first I meet thou in Cilicia plut and down the silver stream of Cydnus thou in Venus shape come sail while the air be ravish with thy music and the wind in amorous gale do kiss thy silken sail thy maid in grace habit do attend and boy like Cupid paint quiver bear while thousand Cupid in those starry eye stand ready draw to wound the stout heart you come like mar himself in threaten arm to ruin i and my poor country then I take that shape because I know no strength no power on earth be able to resist the conquer fury of Antonius that face of thou resist i and do so sweet conquer I be proud to yield and more rejoice in that captivity than any Roman in a triumph do enter Hipparchus how now what news with thou tomorrow we|will peruse they no affair of what import or height soever shall have power to disturb the pleasure of this night our theme tonight be love which oft

away exeunt can no affair of what import soever break one night pleasure well Antonius the totter state thou hold must be support by noble virtue or it can stand Cyprus Phoenicia Coelosyria three wealthy kingdom get with Roman blood and our forefather valour give away as the base hire of a adulterous bed be Cyprus conquer by the sober virtue of Marcus Cato to be thus bestow it|will displease the senate Marcus and antonius friend Alas he know not what true friendship mean but make his friend his slave and which be worse slave to his lust and vice can he else slight our advice so man who Rome have see wear her high honour and of birth as great as he unless he change his mind I shall believe my friendship be ill place and strive to place it better this last act will quick be at Rome they have enough already noble Plancus think you not it will be censure that the roman name be much dishonour by that base surprise Dio. Cass Plutarch of Artavasdes the armenian king who through the street of Alexandria he lead in triumph bind with golden chain force the captive king if all his threat can have enforce so much prostrate to adore proud Cleopatra as if all his act and all the honour of his arm be due to she and not to Rome Calvisius too Plutarch in senate late accuse he for bestow on Cleopatra that so far renown and famous library of Pergamus in which there be two hundred thousand book how many such wild action have she charm enforce his weakness to his testament which now at Rome the vestal virgin keep of which we two be privy to the seal shall it be know will stir all roman hate will his body though he die at Rome Dio Plutarch to be inter at Alexandria but if a war betwixt he and Caesar grow as needs it must although not yet declare for Caesar now be levy man and money through Italy Spain France and Germany against what foe can his design be bend but our Antonius if a war I say betwixt they shall happen tell i noble Titius what shall we do true friend be he himself or be there hope or possibility he can be so but shall our valour toil in sweat and blood only to gain a roman monarchy for Cleopatra and the|effeminate rout of base Canope shall her timbrel fright Rome Capitol and her advance pride tread on the neck of captive senator or which be more shall the earth imperial seat Dio. remove from Rome to Egypt swarthy sand for who can tell if mad Antonius have promise she as Caius Marius once promise the Samnite to transfer the state it may be so his dotage be enough to grant it she her pride enough to ask it Manutius plancus in this whole discourse thou speak my very thought no more here come Lucilius whither so fast enter Lucilius my lord down to the fort to wait upon the consul the Roman consul both Titus Domitius Dio.
