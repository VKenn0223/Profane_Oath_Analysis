my dazzle eye do swerve or surfeit more on Juno face than any face of their● it be no partial fault but fault of he belike who eyesight not so perfect be as may decern the brightness of toe rest and if it be permit unto man you god to parley with your secret thought there be that sit upon that sacred seat that will with Paris err in Venus praise but let i cease to speak of error here sith what my

then but sith unto the fair of the three that power that throw it for my father ill do dedicate this ball and safe dare my shepherd skill adventure as I think to judge of form and beauty rather than of Juno state or Pallas worthiness that learn to ken the fair of the flock and praise beauty but by nature aim behold to Venus Paris give this fruit a dayman choose there by full consent and heavenly power shall not repent their deed where it be say beyond desert of she I honour Venus with this golden prize you god alas what can a mortal man decern betwixt the sacred gift of heaven or if I may with reverence reason thus suppose I give and judge corrupt then for hope of that that best do please my thought this apple not for beauty praise alone I may offend sith I be pardon and tempt more than ever creature be with wealth with beauty and with chivalry and so prefer beauty before they all the thing that have enchant heaven itself and for the one contentment be my wealth a shell of salt will serve a shepherd swain a slender banquet in a homely skrip and water run from the silver spring for arm they dread no foe that sit so low a thorn can keep the wind from off my back a sheepcoat thatch a shepherd palace hight of tragic muse shepherd ●on no skill enough be they if Cupid be displease to sing his praise on slender oaten pipe and thus thrice reverend have I tell my tale and crave the torment of my guiltless soul to be measure by my faultless thought if warlike Pallas or the queen of heaven sue to reverse my sentence by appeal be it as please your majesty divine the wrong the hurt not i if any be but she who beauty claim the prize of i Venus withdraw your shepherd for a space till he again be call for into place Juno what will you after this reply but doom with sentence of indifferency and if you will but justice in the cause the man must quite be by heaven law yea gentle jove when Juno suit be move then heaven may see how well she be belove but madam fit it majesty divine in any sort from justice to decline whether the man be guilty yea or no that do not hinder our appeal I trow Phoebus I wot amid this heavenly crew there be that have to say as well as you and Juno I with they and they with i in law and right must needful agree I grant you may agree but be content to doubt upon regard of your agreement and if you mark the man in his defence say thereof as a might with reverence and do you very well I promise you no doubt sir you can note it cunning well Juno if you will appeal you may but first dispatch the shepherd hence away then Vulcan dame be like to have the wrong and that in passion do to Mars belong call Venus and the shepherd in again And ride the man that he may know his pain his pain his pain his never die pain a cause to make to many more complain shepherd thou have be hard with equity and law and for thy star do thou to other calling draw we here dismiss thou hence by order of our senate go take thy way to Troie and there abide thy fate sweet shepherd with such luck in love while thou do live as may the queen of love to any lover give my luck be loss however my love do speed I fear i Paris shall but rue his deed from Ida wood now wend the shepherd boy that in his bosom carry fire to Troy Venus these lady do appeal you see and that they may appeal the god agree it rest then that you be well content to stand in this unto our final judgement and if king Priam son do well in this the law of heaven will not lead amiss but sacred jupiter may thy daughter choose she may with reason this appeal refuse yet if they be unmoved in their shame be it a stain and blemish to their name a deed to far unworthy of the place unworthy Pallas lance or Juno mace and if to beauty it bequeath be I doubt not but it will return to i Venus there be no more ado than so it rest where the god do it bestow but lady under favour of your rage however it be you play upon the vantage then dame that we more free may debate and here the|indifferent sentence of this senate withdraw you from this presence for a space till we have thorough question of the cac● Diana shall|be your guide nor shall you need yourselves to inquire how thing do here succeed we will as we resolve give you to know by general doom how every thing do go thy will my wish fair lady will you wend beshrew she who this sentence do offend now jove be just and
