thing that there be not a handsome maid in a whole county can be quiet for he he may be good at that sport still for there be almost none of his sect hold any other game lawful yet do he bear the civil and the best order affection to our kinswoman I speak of yes I remember So love to her person so tender of her honour that nothing but too near affinity of blood can have keep they asunder and
