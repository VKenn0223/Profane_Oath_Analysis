down in blood civil and natural wild and barbarous turn from both their army now gather near our Italy contend to enter several Pompey bring so near by Rome consent for fear of tyrannous Caesar which Caesar fear to be do in favour of Pompey and his passage to the empire have bring on he for intervention and such a flock of puttock follow Caesar for fall of his ill-disposed purse that never yet spare cross to Aquiline virtue as well may make all civil spirit suspicious look how against great rain a stand pool of paddock toad and water-snake put up their speckle throat above the venomous lake croak and gasp for some fresh fall drop to quench their poison thirst be near to stifle with clotter purge of their own foul bane so still where Caesar go there thrust up head impostor flatterer favourite and bawd buffoon intelligencer select wit close murderer mountebank and decay thief to gain their baneful life relief from he from Britain Belgia France and Germany the scum of either country chuse by he to be his black guard and red agent here swarm about he and all these be say to be suborn in chief against yourself since Caesar chief fear that you will sit this day his opposite in the cause for which both you be send for home and he have steal access so soon here Pompey whole rest raise to his encounter and on both side Rome in general uproar which sir if you see and know how for the danger all suspect to this your worthy friend for that know freedom his spirit will use this day against both the rival his wife and family mourn no food no comfort allow they for his danger you will use your utmost power to stay he from the senate all this day session he|be too wise Statilius for all be nothing Nothing sir I see Castor and Pollux temple thrust up full with all the damn crew you have late name the market place and suburb swarm with they and where the senate sit be ruffian point to keep from enter the degree that go up to the bench all other but the consul Caesar and Pompey and the senator and all for no cause but to keep out Cato with any violence any villainy and be this nothing sir be his one life on who all good life and their good depend in Rome whole empire all the justice there that|be free and simple all such virtue too and all such knowledge nothing nothing all away Statilius how long shall thy love exceed thy knowledge of i and the god who right thou wrong for my right have not their power to guard i in a cause of they their justice and integrity include in what I stand for he that fear the god for guard of any goodness all thing fear earth sea and air heaven darkness broad daylight rumor and silence and his very shade and what a aspen soul have such a creature how dangerous to his soul be such a fear in who cold fit be all heaven justice shake to his faint thought and all the goodness there due to all good man by the god own vow nay by the firmness of their endless be all which shall fail as soon as any one good to a good man in they for his goodness proceed from they and be a beam of they o never more Statilius may this fear taint thy bold bosom for thyself or friend more than the god be fearful to defend Come let he go Statilius and your fright this man have inward guard past your young sight exeunt welcome come stand by i in what be fit for our poor city safety nor respect her proud foe corruption or our danger of what see face soever I be you but what alas sir can the weakness do against our whole state of we only two you know our statist spirit be so corrupt and servile to the great that what cross they or their own particular wealth or honour they will not enterprise to save the empire move you for enter only Pompey army which if you gain for he for i all justice will join with my request of enter i but may we not win Cato to our friendship by honour speech nor persuasive gift not all the violence that can be use of power or set authority can stir he much less fair word win or reward corrupt he and therefore all mean we must use to keep he from off the bench give you the course for that and if he offer entry I have fellow will serve your will on he at my give signal he be the man that sit so close to Caesar and hold the law there whisper see the cowherd have guard of arm man get against one naked I|will part their whisper virtue Come in away unworthy groom do take it Cato fear no great of they thou seek the people good and these their own brave Cato what a countenance he put on let|we give his noble will our utmost power be bold in all thy will for be just thou may defy the god consul and reverend father and you people who voice be the voice of the god I here have draw a law by good consent for enter into Italy the army of Rome great Pompey that his force here as well as he great Rome may rest secure from danger or the yet still smoke fire of Catiline abhor conspiracy of which the very chief be leave alive only chastise but with a gentle prison put they to death then and strike dead our fear that well you urge by their unfit survival rather than keep it quick and two life give it by entertain Pompey army too that give as great cause of our fear as they for their conspiracy only be to make one tyrant over all the state of Rome And Pompey army suffer to be enter be to make he or give he mean to be so in purpose clear sir which I|will illustrate with a clear example if it be day the sun|be above the earth which follow not you|will answer for it|be day when first the morning break and yet be then the body of the sun beneath the earth but he be virtual above it too because his beam be there and who then know not his golden body will soon after mount So Pompey army enter Italy yet Pompey|be not in Rome but Pompey beam who see not there and consequent he be in all mean enthrone in the|empery example prove not we will have the army of Pompey enter we which we intend you have you already buy the people voice or bear our consul or our senate here so small love to their country that their will beyond their country right be so perverse to give a tyrant here entire command which I have prove as clear as day they do if either the conspirator survive be let to live or Pompey army enter both which beat one sole path and threat one danger consul and honour father the sole entry of Pompey army I|will not yet examine but for the great conspirator yet live which Cato will conclude as oneself danger to our dear country and deter all therefore that love their country from their life defence I see no reason why such danger hang on their save life be still safe keep in prison and since close prison to a roman freedom ten fold torment more than direct death who can be think to love the less his country that seek to save their life and lest myself thus speak for they be unjust touch with any less doubt of my country love why reverend father may it be esteem self praise in i to prove myself a chief both in my love of she and in desert of her like love in i for he that do most honour to his mistress well may boast without least question that he love her most and though thing long since do be long since know and so may seem superfluous to repeat yet be forget as thing never do their repetition needful be in justice to|enflame the shame of that oblivion for hope it will seem no less impair to other act to true tell my own put all together I have pass they all that by their act can boast themselves to be their country lover first in those wild kingdom subdue to Rome by my unwearied toil which I dissavage and make noble civil next in the multitude of those rude realm that so I fashion and to Rome young empire of old have add then the battle number this hand have fight and win for she with all those infinite of dreadful enemy I slay in they twice fifteen hundred thousand all able soldier I have drive at once before my force and in sundry onset a thousand thousand of they put to sword beside I take in less than ten year time by strong assault above eight hundred city three hundred several nation in that space subdue to my country all which service I trust may interest i in her love public and general enough to acquit i of any self-love past her common good for any motion of particular justice by which her general empire be maintain that I can make for those accuse prisoner which be but by the way that so the reason Metellus make for enter Pompey army may not more weighty seem than to agree with those imprison noble vital safety which grant or but yield fit to be may well extenuate the necessity of enter Pompey army all that need I take away before and reason give for a necessity to keep it out who entry I think he himself affect not since I as well think he affect not the|empire and both those thought hold since he love his country in my great hope of he too well to seek his sole rule of she when so many soul so hard a task approve it nor my hope of his sincere love to his country build on sandy ground than Caesar since he can as good card show for it as Caesar do and quit therein the close aspersion of his ambition seek to employ his army in the breast of Italy let i not thus imperial bench and senate feel myself beat about the ear and toss with other breathe to any coast they please and not put some stay to my error in they the god can witness that not my ambition have bring to question the|entry of my army and therefore not suspect the effect of which that entry be suppose the cause which be a will in i to give my power the rule of Rome sole empire that most strange will put my will in other power and power unforfeit by my fault in other will my self-love out of which all this must rise I will not wrong the know proof of my love to this my native city public good to quit or think of nor repeat those proof confirm in those three triumph I have make for conquest of the whole inhabit world first Africa Europe and then Asia which never consul but myself can boast nor can blind fortune vaunt her partial hand in any part of all my service though some have say she be the page of Caesar both sail march fight and prepare his fight in very order of his battle the part she play for he invert nature as give calmness to the|enrgage sea impose summer weather on stern winter wing the slow foot he do command and his most cowherd make fierce of hand and all this ever when the force of man be quite exceed in it all and she in the|instant add she clear deity yet she for i I both disclaim and scorn and where all fortune be renounce no reason will think one man transfer with affectation of all Rome empire for he must have fortune that go beyond a man and where so many their handful find with it the one be mad that undergo it and where that be clear the|impute mean to it which be my suit for entry of my army I confute my part sir rest that let great Pompey bear what spirit he list it|be needful yet for Rome that this law be establish for his army it|be then as needful to admit in i or else let both lay down our arm for else to take my charge off and leave Pompey his you wrongful accuse i to intend a tyranny among you and shall give Pompey full mean to be himself a tyrant be it then your will that Pompey shall cease arm for shame then yield to this clear equity that both may leave their arm Read but this law and you shall see a difference betwixt equity and your indifferency all man objection answer read it notary nor thou shall read it be a thing so vain pretend cause for Pompey army entry that only by thy complice and thou it|be forge to set the senate in a uproar pull down this Cato author of faction and to prison with he what outrage show you sheath your insolent sword or be proclaim your country foe and traitor how insolent a part be this in you to offer the imprisonment of Cato when there be right in he be form so answer with term and place to send we both to prison if of our own ambition we shall offer the|entry of our army for who know that of we both the best friend to his country and free from his own particular end be in his power will not assume the empire and have it can rule the state so well as now it|be govern for the common good accuse yourself sir if your conscience urge it or of ambition or corruption or insufficiency to rule the empire and sound not i with your lead lead it|be gold and spirit of gold too to the politic dross with which false Caesar sound man and for which his praise and honour crown they who sound not the inmost sand of Caesar for but sand be all the rope of your great part affect you speak well and be learn and golden speech do nature never give man but to guild a copper soul in he and all that learning that hearty be spend in paint speech be mere paint and no solid knowledge but you|have another praise for temperance which nought commend your free choice to be temperate for so you must be at least in your meal since you|have a malady that tie you to it for fear of daily fall in your aspire and your disease the god never give to man but such a one as have a spirit too great for all his body passage to serve it which note the|excess of your ambition the malady chance where the pore and passage through which the spirit of a man be bear so narrow be and straight that oftentimes they intercept it quite and choke it up and yet because the greatness of it note a heat mere fleshly and of blood rank fire goat be of all beast subject to it most yourself may have it then if those fault cause it but deal this man ingenious to tax man with a frailty that the god inflict the god inflict on man disease never or other outward maim but to decipher correct and order some rude vice within they and why decipher they it but to make man note and shun and tax it to the|extreme nor will I see my country hope abuse in any man command in her empire if my more trial of he make i see more into his intricacy and my freedom have spirit to speak more than observer servile be free sir of your insight and your speech and speak and see more than the world beside I must remember I have hear of one that fame give out can see through oak and stone and of another set in Sicily that can discern the carthaginian navy and number they distinct leave harbour though full a day and night fail distant thence but these thing reverend father I conceive hardly appear to you worth grave belief and therefore since such strange thing have be see in my so deep and foul detraction by only lyncean Pompey who be most love and believe of Rome most famous whore infamous Flora by so fine a man as Galba or sarmentus any jester or flatterer may draw through a lady ring by one that all his soldier call in scorn great Agamemnon or the king of man I rest unmoved with he and yield to you to right my wrong or his abuse allow away I|will hear no more I hear it thunder my lord all you that love the good of Rome I charge you follow i all such as slay be friend to Caesar and their country foe go thou be a thief to Rome discharge thy army or be proclaim forthwith her open foe Pompey I charge thou help thy injure country with what power thou have arm and levy more from whence presage you this I know it yet let we do like ourselves exeunt it|be like so and I purpose to enforce it not possible nor by enforcive usage hold keep out what honour Cato enter choose thy place no more what shall one say to he he will be stoical where fit place be not give it must be take say like a God we must endure these people do begin it follow not what rest then this of all part be disclaim can this be answer what else no no shall Caesar cease his arm ay I we indifferent stand he shall not read it I will read it then I have it sir in memory and will speak it thou shall be dumb as soon come down sir he draw and all draw hence you mercenary ruffian my lord you make all Rome amaze to hear the|event will fall out contrary my lord war war oh Caesar peace peace worthy Pompey
