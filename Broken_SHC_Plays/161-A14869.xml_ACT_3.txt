absolute will Contarino heir now if it can be prove that you have issue by lord Ercole I will make you inherit his land too how|be this issue by he he dead and I a virgin I know you will wonder how it can be do but I have lay the case so radical not all the lawyer in Christendom shall find any the least flaw in|it I have a mistress of the order of saint Clare a beauteous nun who be cloister ere she know the heat her blood will arrive to have only time enough to repent and idleness sufficient to fall in love with i and to be short I have so much disorder the holy order I have get this nun with child excellent work make for a dumb midwife I be glad you grow thus pleasant now will I have you present give out that you be full two month quicken with child by Ercole which rumour can beget no scandal to you since we will affirm the precontract be so exact do by the same word use in the form of marriage that with a little dispensation a money matter it shall be register absolute matrimony so then I conceive you my conceive child must prove your bastard right for at such time my mistress fall in labour you must feign the like it|be a pretty feat this but I be not capable of it not capable no for the thing you will have i counterfeit be most essential put in practice nay it|be do I be with child already ha by who by Contarino do not knit the brow the precontract shall justify it it shall nay I will get some singular fine churchman or though he be a plural one shall affirm he couple we together o misfortune your child must then be repute Ercole your hope be dash then since your votary issue must not inherit the land no matter for that so I preserve her fame I be strange puzzle why suppose that she be bring abed before you and we conceal her issue till the time of your delivery and then give out that you have two at a birth ha be not excellent and what resemblance think you will they have to one another twin be still alike but this be not your aim you will have your child inherit Ercole land o my sad soul have you not make i yet wretched enough but after all this frosty age in youth which you have witch upon i you will seek to poison my fame that|be do already no sir I do but feign it to a fatal purpose as I think what purpose if you have love or tender my dear honour you will have lock your poniard in my heart when I name I be with child but I must live to linger out till the consumption of my own sorrow kill i stay sister I will utter to you a business but I be very loath a thing indeed nature will have compassionate conceal till my mother eye be close pray what|be that sir you do observe with what a dear regard our mother tender the lord Contarino yet how passionate she seek to cross the match why this be mere to blind the eye of|the world for she do know that you will marry he and he be capable my mother dote upon he and it be plot cunning between they after you be marry live all three together in one house a thing I can whisper without horror why the malice scarce of devil will suggest incontinence between they two I remember since his hurt she have be very passionate inquire after his health upon my soul this jewel with a piece of the holy cross in|it this relic profess as you say love to my mother wherefore do he make i his heir his will be make afore he go to fight when he be first a suitor to you to fight o well remember if he love my mother wherefore do he lose his life in my quarrel for the affront sake a word you understand not because Ercole be pretend rival to he to clear your suspicion I be gull in|it too shall he not have fight upon|it he have undergo the censure of a coward How come you by this wretched knowledge his surgeon overhear it as he do sigh it out to his confessor some half hour fore he die I will have the surgeon hang for abuse confession and for make i so wretched by|the report can this be truth no but direct falsehood as ever be banish the court do you ever hear of a mother that have keep her daughter husband for her own tooth he fancy you in one kind for his lust and he love our mother in another kind for her money the gallant fashion right but come never think on|it throw the foul to the devil that hatch it and let this bury all ill that|be in|it she be our mother I never do find any thing in|the world turn my blood so much as this here|be such a conflict between apparent presumption and unbelief that I shall die in|it o if there be another world in|the moon as some fantastic dream I can wish all man the whole race of they for their inconstancy send thither to people that why I protest I now affect the lord Ercole memory better than the other but be Contarino live I do call any thing to witness that the divine law prescribe we to strengthen a oath be he live and in health I will never marry with he nay since I have find the world so false to i I|will be as false to it I will mother this child for you ha most certain it will be guile part of my sorrow o most assure make you smile to think how many time in|the world lordship descend to diverse man that may and truth be know be heir for any thing belong to|the flesh as well to the Turk rich eunuch but do you not think I shall have a horrible strong breath now why o with keep your counsel it|be so terrible foul Come come come you must leave these bitter flash must I dissemble dishonesty you have diverse counterfeit honesty but I hope here|be none will take exception I now must practise the art of a great belly woman and go fain their qualm and swound dine in my bed some two hour afternoon and when you be up make to your petticoat a quilt preface to advance your belly I have a strange conceit now I have know some woman when they be with child have long to beat their husband what if I to keep decorum exercise my longing upon my tailor that way and noddle he sound he|will make the large bill for|it I|will get one shall be as tractable to|it as stockfish o my fantastical sorrow can I now be miserable enough unless I wear a pied fool coat nay worse for when our passion such giddy and uncertain change breed we be never well till we be mad indeed So nothing in the world can have do this but to beget in she a strong distaste of the lord Contarino o jealousy how violent especial in woman how often have it raise the devil up in form of a law case my especial care must be to nourish crafty this fiend between the mother and the daughter that the deceit be not perceive my next task that my sister after this suppose childbirth be persuade to enter into religion it|be conclude she must never marry so

order for their come back o here|be my mother I have strange news for you my sister be with child I do look now for some great misfortune to follow for indeed mischief be like the visit of franciscan friar they never come to pray upon we single in what estate leave you Contarino strange that you can skip from the former sorrow to such a question I|will tell you in the absence of his surgeon my charity do that for he in a trice they will have do at leisure and be pay for|it I have kill he ha you have give he the wound you speak of quite through your mother heart I will heal it present mother for this sorrow belong to your error you will have he live because you think he|be father of the child but jolenta vow by all the right of truth it|be Ercole it make i smile to think how cunning my sister can be draw to the contract and yet how familiar to his bed dove never couple without a kind of murmur o I be very sick your old disease when you be grieve you be trouble with the mother I be rapt with the mother indeed that I ever bear such a son pray tend my sister I be infinite full of business stay you will mourn for Contarino o by all mean it|be fit my sister be his heir I will make
