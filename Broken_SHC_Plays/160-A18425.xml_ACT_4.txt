any kind their kind admirer still or do the state of any best man here associate and every true soul shall be here so sever from love of such man as here drown their soul as all the world do Cato sole accept to who I|will fly now and my wife in way poor lady and poor child worse than fatherless visit and comfort Come Demetrius they disguise themselves we now must suit our habit to our fortune and since these change ever chance to great nor desire to be do fortune to exceed it what she can a Pompey or a Caesar but a man exeunt o we have slay not conquer Roman blood pervert the|event and desperate blood let out with their own sword do ever man before envy their own life since another live who they will wilful conceive their foe and forge a tyrant mere in their fear to justify their slaughter consul fury be sir their fault their grief the great number be only slave that leave their blood to ruth and altogether but six thousand slay however many god and man can witness themselves enforce it much against the most I can enforce on Pompey for our peace of all slay yet if Brutus only live I shall be comfort for his life save will weigh the whole six thousand that be lose but much I fear his death because the battle full strike now he yet abide unfound I see he fight near the battle end but sudden give off as bend to fly I submit to Caesar my life and fortune a more welcome fortune be Brutus than my conquest sir I fight against your conquest and yourself and merit I must acknowledge a much stern welcome you fight with i sir for I know your arm be take for your country not for Pompey and for my country I fight nothing less than he or both the mighty-stomached consul both who I hear have slay themselves before they will enjoy life in the good of Caesar but I be nothing worse how ill soever they and the great authority of Rome will fain enforce i by their mere suspicion love they their country better than her Brutus or know what fit noblesse and a roman with free soul than Brutus those that live shall see in Caesar justice and whatever may make i worthy both their life and love that I have lose the one without my merit and they the other with no roman spirit be you impair to live and joy my love only requite i Brutus love but Caesar and be in all the power of Caesar Caesar in which free wish I join your father Cato for who I|will haste to Utica and pray his love may strengthen my success today exeunt take you no note that I take it nor let any servant beside yourself of all my father near serve any mood he serve with any knowledge of this or any other Caesar come and give his army wing to reach this town not for the town sake but to save my father who just he suspect to be resolve of any violence to his life before he will preserve it by a tyrant favour for Pompey have miscarry and be flee be true to i and to my father life and do not tell he nor his fury serve with any other I will die my lord ere I observe it what fear fly here on all side what wild look be squint at i from man mere suspicion that I be wild myself and will enforce what will be take from i by the tyrant no will you only ask life he will think his own life give more strength in give your ask what|be he own of he he scorn shall have the least drop in it at his disposure no Statilius Men that have forfeit life by break law or have be overcome may beg their life but I have ever be in every justice better than Caesar and be never conquer or make to fly for life as Caesar be but have be victor ever to my wish against whosoever ever have oppose where Caesar now be conquer in his conquest in the ambition he till now deny take upon he to give life when death be tenfold due to his most tyrannous self no right no power give he to raise a army which in despite of Rome he lead about slaughter her loyal subject like a outlaw nor be he better tongue show falsehood be to bloody death his part so much admire vainglory villainy and at best you can feed with the pare of a worthy man my fame affirm my life receive from he I|will rather make a beast my second father the god avert from every roman mind the name of slave to any tyrant power why be man ever just but to be free against all injustice and to bear about he as well all mean to freedom every hour as every hour he shall be arm for death which only be his freedom but Statilius death be not free for any man election till nature or the law impose it on he must a man go to law then when he may enjoy his own in peace if I can use my own myself must I of force reserve it to serve a tyrant with it all just man not only may enlarge their life but must from all rule tyrannous or live unjust I|will prove he be be not the life of all man bind to justice and therefore not to serve injustice justice itself ought ever to be free and therefore every just man be a part of that free justice shall be free as it that all that know not what law be nor free can perform the fit justice of a man in kingdom common good may be force but be not every just man to himself the perfect law then to himself be every just man life subordinate again sir be not our free soul infuse to everybody in her absolute end to rule that body in which absolute rule be she not absolute empress of it And be empress may she not dispose it and the life in it at her just pleasure no she not destroy it when she dislive it that their freedom may go firm together like their power and organ rather than let it live a rebel to she profane that divine conjunction betwixt she and it nay a disjunction make betwixt they worse than death in kill quick that which in just death live be dead to she if to her rule dead and to her alive if die in her just rule the body live not when death have rest it yet it|be free and keep fit for rejunction in man second life which die rebel to the soul be far unfit to join with she in perfect life in apparent reason which I|will prove clear as nature work in all thing to a end so in the|appropriate honour of that end all thing precedent have their natural frame and therefore be there a proportion betwixt the end of those thing and their prime for else there can not be in their creation always or for the most part that firm form in their still like existence that we see in each full creature what proportion then have a immortal with a mortal substance and therefore the mortality to which a man be subject rather be asleep then bestial death since sleep and death be call the twin of nature for if absolute death and bestial seize the body of a man then be there no proportion in his part his soul be free from death which otherwise retain divine proportion for as sleep no disproportion hold with humane soul but apt quicken the proportion betwixt they and body make body fit to give up form to soul which be their end so death twin-born of sleep resolve all man body heavy part in light nature make a reunion with the sprightly soul when in a second life their being give hold their proportion firm in high heaven hold you our body shall revive resume our soul again to heaven past doubt though other think heaven a world too high for our low reach not know the sacred sense of he that sing jove can let down a golden chain from heaven which tie to earth shall fetch up earth and sea and what|be that golden chain but our pure soul a golden beam of he let down by he that govern with his grace and draw by he can hoist this earthy body up to he the sea and air and all the element compress in it not while it|be thus concrete but fine by death and then give heavenly heat your happy exposition of that place who sacred depth I never hear so sound evict glad grant from I you hold a truth it|be a good cheerful doctrine for good man but son and servant this be only argue to spend our dear time well and no life urge to any violence further than his owner and grave man hold fit let|we talk of Caesar he|be the great subject of all talk and he be hot haste on be supper ready why then let|we in and eat our cool submission will quench Caesar heat statilus my reason must not strengthen you in error nor learn Athenodorus gentle yield talk with some other deep philosopher or some divine priest of the know god and hear their reason in mean time come sup exeunt fly fly the day be lose before it|be fight the roman fear their shadow upbray i not go to go on you|be clear my lord o no my lord he come here see sir to what use take you that my lord o my lord and father I ask my life of he by death must they enlarge their life by death a man|be not bind to that they be then wherefore be there law for death suppose not to destroy it it shall not join with she again it shall in reason shall it hear and judge it sir be|it not a manly truth and mere divine
