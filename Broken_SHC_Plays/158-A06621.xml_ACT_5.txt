poor Midas and pity he I marvel there be no answer fond Midas how can thou ask pity of he who thou have so much abuse or why do thou abuse the world both to seem ignorant in not acknowledge a offence and impudent so open to crave pardon Apollo will not answer but Midas must not cease Apollo divine Apollo Midas have ass ear yet let pity sink into thy ear and tell when he shall be free from this shame or what may mitigate his sin tush Apollo be tune his pipe or at barleybreak with Daphne or assay on some shepherd coat or take measure of a serpent skin be I Midas I will rather cut these ear off close from my head than stand whimper before such a blind God thou be barbarous not valiant god must be entreat not command thou will quench fire with a sword and add to my shame which be more than any prince can endure thy rudeness which be more than any sensible creature will follow divine Apollo what shall become of Midas accept this lute these berry these simples these taper if Apollo take any delight in music in Daphne in physic in eternity it be good to expound these oracle that the learned man in Phrygia be assemble otherwise the remedy will be as impossible to be have as the cause to be sift I foresee some old see which shall be doubtful who will gad to such god that must be honour if they speak without sense and the oracle wonder at as though it be above sense no more Martius I be the learned in Phrygia to interpret these oracle and though shame have hitherto cause i to conceal it now I must unfold it by necessity thus destiny bring i not only to be cause of all my shame but reporter thou Sophronia and you my lord harken when I have bathe my self in Pactolus and see my wish to float in the wave I wish the wave to overflow my body so melancholy my fortune make i so mad my folly yet by hunt I think to ease my heart And come at last to the hill Tmolus I perceive Apollo and Pan contend for excellency in music among nymph they require also my judgement I who the loss of gold make discontent and the possess desperate either dull with the humour of my weak brain or deceive by thickness of my deaf ear prefer the harsh noise of Pan pipe before the sweet stroke of Apollo lute which cause Phoebus in justice as I now confess and then as I see in anger to set these ear on my head that have wring so many tear from my eye for stretch my hand to Lesbos I find that all the god have spurn at my practise and those island scorn they my pride the god disdain my policy man my mine have be empty by soldier my soldier spoil by war my war without success because usurp my usurp without end because my ambition above measure I will therefore yield myself to Bacchus and acknowledge my wish to be vanity to Apollo and confess my judgement to be foolish to mar and say my war be unjust to Diana and tell my affection have be unnatural and I doubt not what a god have do to make i know myself all the god will help to undo that I may come to myself be it possible that Midas shall be so overshoot in judgement unhappy Midas who wit melt with his gold and who gold be consume with his wit what talk Sophronia to herself Nothing but that since Midas have confess his fault to we he also acknowledge it to Apollo I will Sophronia sacred Apollo thing pass can be recall repent they may be behold Midas not only submit himself to punishment but confess his peevishness be glad for shame to call that peevishness which indeed be folly whatsoever Apollo shall command Midas will execute then attend Midas I accept thy submission and sacrifice so as yearly at this temple thou offer sacrifice in submission withal take Apollo council which if thou scorn thou shall find thy destiny I will not speak in riddle all shall|be plain because thou be dull but all certain if thou be obstinate it may be Sophronia that neither you nor any else understand Apollo because none of you have the heart of a king but my thought expound my fortune and my fortune hang upon my thought that great Apollo that join to my head ass ear have put into my heart a lion mind I see that by obscure shadow which you can discern in fresh colour Apollo in the depth of his dark answer be to i the glister of a bright sun I perceive and yet not too late that Lesbos will not be touch by gold by force it can that the god have pitch it out of the world as not to be control by any in the world though my hand be gold yet I must not think to span over the main ocean though my soldier be valiant I must not therefore think my quarrel just there be no way to nail the crown of Phrygia fast to my daughter head but in let the crown of other sit in quiet on they Midas how dare thou reply see i resolve thy counsel have spill more blood than all my soldier lance let none be so hardy as to look to cross i sacred Apollo if sacrifice yearly at thy temple and submission hourly in my own court if fulfil thy counsel and correct my councillor may shake off these ass ear I here before thou vow to shake off all envy abroad and at home all tyranny honour be Apollo Midas be restore fortunate Midas that feel thy head lighten of dull ear and thy heart of deadly sorrow Come my lord let we repair to our palace in which Apollo shall have a stately statue erect every month will we solemnize there a feast and here every year a sacrifice Phrygia shall|be govern by god not man jest the god make beast of man so my counsel of war shall not make conquest in their own conceit nor my councillor in peace make i poor to enrich themselves So bless be Apollo quiet be Lesbos happy be Midas and to begin this solemnity let we sing to Apollo for so much as music nothing can content Apollo
