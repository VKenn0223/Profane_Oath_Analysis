destine some more fit general who loss as heaven avert such a misfortune shall it happen may less concern the state it|be not the least among the blessing heaven have shower upon we that we be happy in such love subject to govern who when we in peace be ash we leave they a successor who they true reverence a love people and a love sovereign make kingdom true fortunate and flourish but I believe Simanthes their intent though we confirm they will scarce take effect my Abilqualit like a princely lion in view of|his prey will scarce be overcome to leave the honour of the persian war in|his hope already vanquish by his valour and rest in lazy quiet while that triumph be ravish by another with the pardon of your most sacred majesty it|be fit then your great command forbid the prince voyage boldness enforce youth to hard achievement before their time make they run forth like lapwing from their warm nest part of the shell yet stick unto their downy head sir good success be oft more fatal far than bad one win ●●st from a flatter die tempt a gamester to hazard his whole fortune this be dull fruitless philosophy he that fall noble win as much honour by his loss as conquest this rule may hold well among common man but not among prince such a prince as we be who know as well to conquer man affection as he do enemy shall not be expose to every new cause honourable danger prince Abilqualit fair and win carriage have steal possession of the people heart they dote on he since his late spanish conquest as new make bride on their much covet husband and they will pine like
