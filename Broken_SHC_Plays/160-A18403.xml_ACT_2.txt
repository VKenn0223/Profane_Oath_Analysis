this desperate quarrel spring out of their envy to D'Ambois sudden bravery and great spirit neither be worth their envy less than either will make the gall of envy overflow she feed on outcast entrails like a kite in which foul heap if any ill lie hide she stick her beak into it shake it up and hurl it all abroad that all may view it corruption be her nutriment but touch she with any precious ointment and you kill she when she find any filth in man she feast and with her black throat bruit it through the world be sound and healthful but if she but taste the slender pittance of commend virtue she surfeit of it and be like a fly that pass all the body sound part and dwell upon the sore or if her squint eye have power to find none there she forge some she make that crooked ever which be straight call valour giddiness justice tyranny a wise man may shun she she not herself whither soever she fly from her harm she bear her foe still clasp in her own arm and therefore cousin Guise let we avoid she what Atlas or Olympus lift his head so far past covert that with air enough my word may be inform and from his height I may be see and hear through all the world a tale so worthy and so fraught with wonder stick in my jaw and labour with event come thou from D'Ambois from he and the rest his friend and enemy who stern fight I see and hear their word before and in the fray relate at large what thou have see and hear I see fierce D'Ambois and his two brave friend enter the field and at their heel their foe which be the famous soldier Barrisor L'anou and Pyrrhot great in deed of arm all which arrive at the even piece of earth the field afford the three challenger turn head draw all their rapier and stand rank when face to face the three defendant meet they alike prepare and resolute alike like bonfire of contributory wood every man look show feed with either spirit as one have be a mirror to another like form of life and death each take from other and so be life and death mix at their height that you can see no fear of death for life nor love of life for death but in their brow Pyrrho opinion in great letter shine that life and death in all respect be one past there no sort of word at their encounter as Hector betwixt the host of Greece and Troy when Paris and the spartan king shall end the nine year war hold up his brazen lance for signal that both host shall cease from arm and hear he speak so Barrisor advise advance his naked rapier betwixt both side rip up the quarrel and compare six life then lay in balance with six idle word offer remission and contrition too or else that he and D'Ambois may conclude the other danger D'Ambois like the last but Barrisor friend be equal engage in the main quarrel never will expose his life alone to that they all deserve and for the other offer of remission D'Ambois that like a laurel put in fire sparkle and spit do much much more than scorn that his wrong shall incense he so like chaff to go so soon out and like light paper approve his spirit at once both fire and ash so draw they lot and in they fate appoint that Barrisor shall fight with fiery D'Ambois Pyrhot with Melinell with Brisac L'anou and then like flame and powder they commix so sprightly that I wish they have be spirit that the never shut wound they needs must open may as they open shut and never kill but D'Ambois sword that lighten as it fly shoot like a point comet at the face of manly Barrisor and there it stick thrice pluck he at it and thrice draw on thrust from he that of himself be free as fire who thrust still as he pluck yet past belief he with his subtle eye hand body scape at last the deadly bite point tug off on fall his yet undaunted foe so fierce that only make more horrid with his wound great D'Ambois shrink and give a little ground but soon return redouble in his danger and at the heart of Barrisor seal his anger then as in Arden I have see a oak long shake with tempest and his lofty top bend to his root which be at length make loose even groan with his weight he begin to nod this way and that as loath his curl brow which he have oft wrap in the sky with storm shall stoop and yet his

sorrow and fury like two opposite fume meet in the upper region of a cloud at the report make by this worthy fall break from the earth and with they rise revenge enter with fresh power his two noble friend and under that odds fall surcharge Brisac the friend of D'Ambois before fierce L'anou which D'Ambois see as I once do see in my young travel through Armenia a angry unicorn in his full carrier charge with too quick a eye a jeweller that watch he for the treasure of his brow and ere he can get shelter of a tree nail he with his rich antler to the earth so D'Ambois run upon revenge L'anou who
