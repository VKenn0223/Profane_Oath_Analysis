he be a knave to learn it I believe fair Livia if your sour fire shall see you with your sweet heart he will not be very patient the care be take I|will ask he blessing as a father but never take counsel for a husband there be as much odds between my golden thought and his leaden advice as between his silver hair and my amber lock I know he will cough for anger that I yield not but he shall cough i a fool for his labour where pick your daughter that work out of broad-stitch out of a flirt sampler but let we stay the end this be but the beginning you shall hear two child well bring up parent in these day be grow peevish they rock their child in their cradle till they sleep and cross they about their bridal till their heart ache marriage among they be become a market what will you give with your daughter what jointure will you make for your son and many a match be break off for a penny more or less as though they can not afford their child at such a price when none shall cheapen such ware but affection and none buy it but love learned and scholarlike in deed our parent take great care to make we ask blessing and say grace whenas we be little one and grow to year of judgement they deprive we of the great blessing and the most gracious thing to our mind the liberty of our mind they give we pap with a spoon before we can speak and when we speak for that we love pap with a hatchet because their fancy be grow musty with hoary age therefore nothing can relish in their thought that savour of sweet youth they study twenty year together to make we grow as straight as a wand and in the end by bow we make we as crooked as a cammock for my own part sweet Candius they shall pardon i for I will measure my love by min own judgement not my father purse or peevishness nature have make i his child not his slave I hare Memphio and his son deadly if I wit he will place his affection by his father appointment witty but uncivil be of that mind still my fair Livia let our father lay their purse together we our heart I will never woo where I can love let Stellio enjoy his daughter but what have you wrought here flower fowl beast fish tree plant stone and what not among flower cowslip and lily for our name Candius and Livia among fowl turtle and sparrow for our truth and desire among beast the fox and the ermine for beauty and policy and among fish the cockle and the tortoise because of Venus among tree the vine wreathe about the elm for our embrace among stone asbestos which be hot will never be cold for our constancy among plant time and hearts-ease to note that if we take time we shall ease our heart there|be a girl that know her lerripoop listen and you shall hear my son learning what book be that a fine pleasant poet who entreat of the art of love and of the remedy be there art in love a short art and a certain three rule in 3. line I pray thou repeat they principio quod amare velis reperire labora proximus huic labour est placidam evor be puellam tertius ut longo tempore ducet amor I be no latinist Cand you must construe it so I will and pace it too thou shall be acquaint with case gender and number first one must find out a mistress who before all other he vow to serve second that he use all the mean that he may to obtain she and the last with desert faith and secrecy to study to keep she what|be the remedy death what of all the book be the conclusion this one verse non caret essertu quod voluere dvo what|be that where two be agree it be impossible but they must speed then can we miss therefore give i thy hand Candius soft Livia take i with you it be not good in law without witness and as I remember there must be two witness God give you joy Candius I be worth the bid to dinner though not worthy to be of the counsel I think this hot love have provide but cold cheer tush in love be no lack but blush not Candius you need not be ashamed of your cunning you have make love a book case and spend your time well at school learn to love by art and hate against nature but I perceive the worse child the better lover and my minion have wrought well where every stitch in her sampler be a prick stitch at my heart you take your pleasure on parent they be peevish fool churl overgrow with ignorance because overwear with age little shall thou know the case of a father before thyself be a mother when thou shall breed thy child with continual pain and bring it forth with deadly pang nurse it with thy own pap and nourish it up with motherly tenderness and then find they to curse thou with their heart when they shall ask blessing on their knee and the collop of thy own bowel to be the torture of thy own soul with tear trickle down thy check and drop of blood fall from thy heart thou will in utter of thy mind wish they rather unborn than unnatural and to have have their cradle their grave rather than thy death their bridal but I will not dispute what thou shall have do but correct what thou have do I perceive sow be a idle exercise and that every day there come more thought into thy head than stitch into thy work I|will see whether you can spin a better mind than you have stitch and if I coop you not up then let i be the capon as for you sir boy in stead of pore on a book you shall hold the plough I|will make repentance reap what wantonness have sow but we be both well serve the son must be master the father gaffer what we get together with a rake they cast abroad with a fork and we must weary our leg to purchase our child arm well see that book be but idleness I|will see whether thresh be any occupation thy mind shall stoop to my fortune or i shall break the law of nature how like a micher he stand as though he have truant from honesty get thou in and for the rest let i alone in villain and you pretty minx that must be feed with love upon sop I|will take a order to cram you with sorrow get you in without look or reply let we follow and deal as rigorous with you as I will with mine and you shall see that hot love will wax soon cold I|will tame the proud boy and send he as far from his love as he be from his duty let we about it and also go on with match they to our mind it be happy that we prevent that by chance which we can never yet suspect by circumstance
