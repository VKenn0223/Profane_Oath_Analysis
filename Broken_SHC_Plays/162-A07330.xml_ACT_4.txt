it|be not fit too much to toil they for I fear a sally from Alexandria Antonius be strong in well-provided and skilful horseman and despair of favour since twice you have refuse his proposition will put another valour into he his hope as near as I conjecture they be to break through your troop and get to sea for yet he have a fleet that may transport he to other land to gather new supply but any fortune will prove high far to he then stay here without all hope to be shut up in a besiege town in my opinion let your march be slow and gentle that the horse may be refresh and we prevent the worst
