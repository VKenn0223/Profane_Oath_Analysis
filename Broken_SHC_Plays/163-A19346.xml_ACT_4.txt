a act as fly beyond all thought of recompense but the two captive king which thou have take shall give thou thy reward they both have name thou their Cid before i which in their tongue sound as much as lord in we and this fair title I will not envy thou from henceforth be their Cid that at thy name the moor may tremble and that my subject hear it may know thy value and how much to thou I owe let not your majesty confound your servant with too much shame to set so high a prize upon so poor a service I must blush to see such honour do so slender merit my debt to you sir and my country be the blood I live by and the air I breathe and when I lose they for so fair a object I do sir but the duty of a subject Few of those who their duty bind to serve i can so acquit themselves as thou have do suffer then thy just praise and at full relate the story of thy victory sir you have hear how in this urgent danger which put the city in so great a tumult a company of my friend meet at my father move i to go upon this enterprise but I crave pardon of your majesty for dare to employ they without leave the danger be at hand so be my friend the hazard of my head make i I dare not appear at court and I have rather lose my life in the defence of the whole state than give it up unto cimena plaint I must excuse the heat of thy revenge the state defend speak in thy defence henceforth Cimena move i but in vain who if I hear it|be but to give her comfort but on with your relation under i this troop advance with such a confidence and so good order that where ere they pass they diffuse courage through the looker on which so much move they that although at first we number but five hundred ere we reach the port we be increase into three thousand two three of these when I arrive I hide in|the bottom of our ship which there I find the rest who number every hour increase lie close to the ground and in deep silence past the great part of that fair night away to the guard I give command to do the like affirm stout that I have your order for what I do at length the glimmer star light make we discover thirty sail come up with a full tide for the swell sea at once pour both itself and they into our haven we let they pass discover none of we in|the haven or the wall and this our silence make they so confident of our surprise that present they land fierce run to meet the ruin which await they then rise we up have receive the signal from those within our ship who start up in arm do so confound the moor that they be fright ere half land they come to pillage but they meet with war at sea and land we bear they down before we many we slay in|the place before they can fall into rank or make the least resistance when sudden in spite of our endeavour their prince rally their disperse troop and from a shame they feel to die so tame they take new courage and restore their rank with their sword draw make their fight on foot then fall the brave of our soldier mix with their captain the land the water their fleet our haven seem a field of slaughter where death do only triumph blood and darkness cover the place what have their valour be who fight thus in the dark have they be see ay on all side encourage our own man some I make fall upon the foe and other I keep from fall from we those that come I range in order put they on the place which they be to make good but what be do we have no mean to know till the first light show we our victory and their loss they see a new supply come to our aid flee now more fierce than before they fight they get into their ship and cut their cable disorderly retreat and not mind whether their king retire or stay behind fear more prevail make they lose their duty they come in with the flood and with the ebb they go away in the mean time their king and some few of their man engage among we sell their life dear enough I bid|them yield but while they have a sword to fight they will not till see their soldier fall about their foot and that alone they must defend themselves they ask who be our leader I be name they yield themselves to i So be this battle end for want of man to fight it out and thus sir when we be about your service sir here|be Cimena come to ask you justice what shall I do I will not have she see thou in stead of thanks I must dismiss thou from i but ere thou leave the court return again unto thy king embrace it|be strange she shall pursue the man thus who she fain will save I|be tell she be in love with he I|will try make show as you be sad at length Cimena content yourself for your desire have meet with their success though Roderigo valour have|get the better of the moor himself have perish with the wound he there receive give thanks to heaven that have give you vengeance her colour|be change already but sir mark her swound and by they how she betray the secret of her soul sure she love he be Roderigo dead then no no he live and still remain thy true and constant lover thou shall enjoy he take thy mirth again sir we as often faint with joy as sadness and when excess of that surprise we it soon confound our sense thou will feign that to do thou a courtesy we shall believe impossibles but here thy sadness have show itself too plain well sir you may add this too if you please to my misfortune and call my swound the effect of grief I must confess I grieve to see myself robe of the life I sue for if he die of wound he have receive for be country good my vengeance be lose and my design betray I ask his death but not a glorious one I will not have he die in|the bed of honour but on a scaffold that his name may rot and his memorial perish it|be no shame to say I love his victory by it he have assure the state and render i a noble sacrifice in stead of flower crown with victorious bay and such a one as I|will have offer to my father ghost but why alas be I transport so Roderigo need not fear what I can do what can a virgin tear despise and scorn your kingdom be to he a place of free security and he shall triumph over i as over his enemy the blood of|the moor shall choke up justice here which must be make a trophy to the victor crime while I among the rest adorn his victory sweet heart you|be too much hurry with your passion we when we render justice use to cast each thing in balance Roderigo kill thy father but he give the first offence equity bind i then to show some sweetness to the first injure but before thou accuse he ask counsel of thy heart of which he|be master I|be sure thy love secret thank thy king who favour keep so brave a lover for thou for i my enemy the author of my miscry the murderer of my father be my just suit so slight that I|be think to be oblige because I be not hear sir since my tear can obtain it of you let the sword I beseech you give i justice by that I|be injure and by that I crave to be revenge of all your cavalier I ask his head to he that bring it i as to the conqueror I give myself the combat end he shall be my husband this I beseech your majesty may be publish by your authority this country custom more ancient than good under the colour of punish unjust attempt have robe the state of its best soldier and often the success do not answer the intent the guilty escape and kill the innocent I must dispense with Roderigo blood it be more precious to i than so slight to be expose to hazard though his spirit force he to do a outrage yet in free his country from the moor he|have free himself how sir for he must you reverse your law which have so often be observe what will the people or the tongue of envy say hear he live by your protection and that it only serve he for a colour to hide his cowardice these be favor sir which bring dishonour with|they to the taker the count dare do a wrong my son dare punish let he maintain the honour he have win since you will have it so let it be do but if Roderigo be expose to all that will come in to fight for such a prize he must be sure to want no enemy I will have only one to|encounter he choose who you will Cimena and choose wise but after this urge i to nothing far an|it please your majesty to let the list be open I shall be the undertaker madam you know your promise I beseech you let i obtain the grace to be your champion what say you Cimena shall he be the man sir I have promise he be ready than tomorrow defer it not so long sir a man of courage be at
