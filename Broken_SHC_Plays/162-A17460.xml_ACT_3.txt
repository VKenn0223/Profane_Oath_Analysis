she at the bar read the indictment nothing but that I do desire to die for it be sin enough that the duke think I be guilty of the fact all the clemency that you can show i or I do desire be to condemn i quick that I must speak it grieve i in a cause which I cud wish never have presidence as it have have too often alas that I who do bleed inward to behold this woman fall by a sin equal to Lucifer from her clear heaven where she stand a star move in his arm as her proper orb that I shall see this woman as I say who have she be a fix one have never shoot from her sphere but as a exhalation draw by the attractive virtue of the sun appear a glorious star yet want matter to maintain his lustre shoot forth his flame and drop from whence it come unto a dunghill so be this woman raise and so she fall that so much beauty which be give for honour and do advance she to it shall cause shame who can tell whether this be the first man that she have sin withal since usual many fault be commit ere one find she promise the fellow of her lust upon condition to make that and what be it a garland a garland of all flower of what effect who know or to what purpose both be as certain as the thing itself how or from whence it come nay more than this she be so impudent to tell the duke and tell he she have swear which the immodest and most profess strumpet never will what name of shame be to be give this woman that will thus lewd suffer the wild tongue prcoclaim performance of so vild a deed and unto he she know do love she so she may perhaps by her beauty and her tear or both together stir compassion in many here and in the duke himself but when her crime shall be remember a crime so beyond mercy be do unto a prince and such a prince as he be what can I less inspire i all you power that think i worthy of authority then without pity to condemn this woman the case be too apparent be it not grave father yes indeed it be I be almost asleep you all do know all you that know the law who pardon the offender do commit a offence equal with he that do punish the harmless innocent than she must die I grieve to speak|it and be so charitable to wish that her reproach may die with she I thank thou for the last speech it be well oh that she now cud speak and clear herself but proceed give sentence if she stay long and I stand by a witness of her tear she|will weep herself guiltless and innocent therefore go on stay who|be that I know not whence come that voice out of the cloud I think for no man dare own it go forward and give sentence stay I say it speak again it come by my ear the court be trouble hear i you minister of justice and thou patron of it and truth that come to you for succour and for safety keep your place for let it be the devil I will hear he and hear shall determine whether he be a spirit of truth or lie the all preserver that guard innocence and often let it pine but never perish can raise a voice from stone or tree or wind to plead the cause that need no eloquence what have this lady do that here you bring she unto a bar of shame it be|it for be virtuous because she have be constant to her lord but some have call her chastity in question that never have a spark in their own breast and have possess the duke from his own thought that she must needs be bad because they be so have every woman so much wit to hide that fault especial and have not she who be the mirror of of her sex for that more than for beauty but she tell the duke she have offend in a idle promise and that|be object to she for a crime a piece of impudence unparallel when have she mean to have wrong her royal lord she will have lock the secret in her heart and set her face with smile beat with kiss suspicion from his bosom but she discover the gift the giver and the vow that buy it who be|it not know dishonesty consist in the deed do not in the speak word and she imagine the deed in which she employ the doer never to be do and so the wickedness let i not be think tedious nor be offensive if I bring to mind the meeting of those two how she reveal that you great duke consent to the fact encourage she unto|it and lead she on if she have be a villain to her death but he look on she and see in her eye the image of fair virtue how it weep give back her vow and free she from his heart in that shape first she stand but again place she as his most roy all mistress and your wife excellent voice go on for I can stand a tedious winter but to hear thou talk so can not I without a rug gown it have be still a maxim she|be not chaste that have not be attempt but she who have stand temptation and resist gold be the pure for be try and virtue put in act appear more glorious when it have wrought itself out of those trouble which will stifle it heaven be assault by the giant once which show jove power the great the pensive soul fight with sin the devil and with death after the victory triumph and sing eternal among the bless angel crown with perpetual peace and happiness but she for be virtuous must die for conquer her affection for love sincere and effectual her lord for have not the cunning to dissemble but for be simple chaste and innocent just noble beauteous excellent in all save what no common woman will have miss for this and for this only she must die no she must live and all the world must die to i before a hair of she shall perish o I have wrong thy goodness now I see|it who be before make blind with jealousy the heaven take thy part and will suffer so much of worthiness to fall at once lest nothing
