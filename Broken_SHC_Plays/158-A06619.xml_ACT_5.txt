Come Hebe here be no time for we to reason it have be best for we thou have be most beautiful we meet the virgin that shall have be offer to Neptune belike either the custom be pardon or she not think fair I can conjecture the cause but I fear the event why shall you fear the God require no boy I will he do then shall I have no fear I be glad he do not tho because if he do I shall have also cause to fear but soft what man or god be this let we close withdraw ourselves into the thicket and do man begin to be equal with god seek by craft to overreach they that by power oversee they do they dote so much on their daughter that they stick not to dally with our deity well shall the inhabitant see that destiny can be prevent by craft nor my anger be appease by submission I will make havoc of Diana nymph my temple shall be die with maiden blood and there shall be nothing more vile than to be a virgin to be young and fair shall be account shame and punishment in so much as it shall be think as dishonourable to be honest as fortunate to be deform o Neptune have thou forget thyself or will thou clean forsake i have Diana therefore bring danger to her nymph because they be chaste shall virtue suffer both pain and shame which always deserve praise and honour praise and honour Neptune nothing less except it be commendable to be coy and honourable to be peevish sweet Neptune if Venus can do any thing let she try it in this one thing that Diana may find as small comfort at thy hand as love have find courtesy at she this be she that hate sweet delight envy love desire mask wanton eye stop amorous ear bridle youthful mouth and under a name or a word constancy entertain all kind of cruelty she have take my son Cupid Cupid my lovely son use he like a prentice whip he like a slave scorn he like a beast therefore Neptune I entreat thou by no other God than the god of love that thou evil entreat this goddess of hate I muse not a little to see you two in this place at this time and about this matter but what say you Diana have you Cupid captive I say there be nothing more vain then to dispute with Venus who untamed affection have breed more brawl in heaven then be fit to repeat in earth or possible to recount in number I have Cupid and will keep he not to dandle in my lap who I abhor in my heart but to laugh he to scorn that have make in my virgin heart such deep scar scar Diana call you they that I know to be bleed wound alas weak deity it stretch not so far both to abate the sharpness of his arrow and to heal the hurt no love wound when they seem green rankle and have a smooth skin without fester to the death within therefore Neptune if ever Venus stand thou in stead further thy fancy or shall at all time be at thy command let either Diana bring her virgin to a continual massacre or release Cupid of his martyrdom it be know Venus that your tongue be as unruly as your thought and your thought as unstaid as your eye Diana can chatter Venus can choose it be a honour for Diana to have Venus mean ill when she so speak well but you shall see I come not to trifle therefore once again Neptune if that be not bury which can never die fancy or that quench which must ever burn affection show thyself the same neptune that I know thou to be when thou be a shepherd and let not Venus word be vain in thy ear since thy be imprint in my heart it be unfit that goddess shall strive and it be unreasonable that I shall not yield and therefore to please both both attend Diana I must honour her virtue deserve no less but Venus I must love I must confess so much Diana restore Cupid to Venus and I will for ever release the sacrifice of virgin if therefore you love your nymph as she do her son or prefer not a private grudge before a common grief answer what you will do I account not the choice hard for have I twenty Cupid I will deliver they all to save one virgin know love to be a thing of all the vain virginity to be a virtue of all the noble I yield Larissa bring out Cupid and now shall it be say that Cupid save those he think to spoil I agree to this willing for I will be wary how my son wander again but Diana can forbid he to wound yes chastity be not within the level of his bow but beauty be a fair mark to hit well I be glad you be agree and say that Neptune have deal well with beauty and chastity here take your son sir boy where have you be always take first by Sappho now by Diana how happen it you unhappy elf come through Diana wood and see so many fair face with fond heart I think for my sport to make they smart and so be take by Diana I be glad I have you and I be glad I be rid of he alas poor boy thy wing clip thy brand quench thy bow burn and thy arrow break ay but it skill not I bear now my arrow in my eye my wing on my thought my brand in my ear my bow in my mouth so as I can wound with look fly with think burn with hear shoot with speak well you shall up to heaven with i for on earth thou will lose i but soft what be these those that have offend thou to save their daughter why have you a fair daughter ay and Melebeus a fair daughter where be they in yonder wood and methinks I see they come well your desert have not get pardon but these goddess jar this be my daughter my sweet Phillida and this be my fair Galathea unfortunate Galathea if this be Phillida accurse Phillida if that be Galathea and be thou all this while enamour of Phillida that sweet Phillida and can thou dote upon the face of a maiden thyself be one on the face of fair Galathea do you both be maiden love one another I have think the habit agreeable with the sex and so burn in the fire of my own fancy I have think that in the attire of a boy there can not have lodge the body of a virgin and so be inflame with a sweet desire which now I find a sour deceit now thing fall out as they do you must leave these fond fond affection nature will have it so necessity must I will never love any but Phillida her love be engrave in my heart with her eye nor I any but Galathea who faith be imprint in my thought by her word a idle choice strange and foolish for one virgin to dote on another and to imagine a constant faith where there can be no cause of affection how like you this Venus I like well and allow it they shall both be possess of their wish for never shall it be say that nature or fortune shall overthrow love and faith be your love unspotted begin with truth continue with constancy and not to be alter till death die Galathea if thy love be not so accurse be thou Phillida if thy love be not so suppose all this Venus what then then shall it be see that I can turn one of they to be a man and that I will be it possible what be to love or the mistress of love unpossible be it not Venus that do the like to Iphis and Ianthe how say you be you agree one to be a boy present I be content so I may embrace Galathea I wish it so I may enjoy Phillida soft daughter you must know whether I will have you a son take i with you Galathea I will keep you as I beget you a daughter Tityrus let you be a boy and if you will i shall not nay my shall not for by that mean my young son shall lose his inheritance why then get he to be make a maiden and then there be nothing lose if there be such change I will Venus can make my wife a man why because she love always to play with man well you be both fond therefore agree to this change or suffer your daughter to endure hard chance how say you Tityrus shall we refer it to Venus I be content because she be a goddess Neptune you will not dislike it not I nor you Diana not I Cupid shall not I will not then let we depart neither of they shall know who lot it shall be till they come to the church-door one shall be do it suffice and satisfy we both do it not Galathea yes Phillida Come Robin I be glad I have meet with thou for now we will make our father laugh at these tale what be these that so malapart thrust themselves into our company forsooth madam we be fortune
