purpose have the god more manifest and present than the sacrifice and temple long since make void and empty of a deity by those which sue for favour and request for he who just here deserve their horrid vengeance we be not meet here to plot a general ruin for a private injury we know and teach the great Donne by the king unto the subject can not give he cause to throw off his faith king be petty god and may tempt we nor be it want or desire of innovation that thus stir we we be in the best ill state already nor ambition to strike at that laurel which the thunder spare no we reverence it
