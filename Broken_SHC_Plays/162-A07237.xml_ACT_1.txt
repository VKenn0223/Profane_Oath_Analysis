but give a pension to all the magistrate you find sing catch or their wife dance for the courtier reel and the duke himself I dare not say distemper but kind and in his totter chair carouse they do the country service if you meet one that eat bread a child of ignorance and breed up in the darkness of no drink in the true posture though he die in the take his drench it skill not what|be a private man for the public honour we have nought else to think on and so dear friend copartner in my travail drink hard and let the health run through the city until it reel again and with i cry long live the duchess here be two lord what think you shall we give the oath to they fie no I know they you need not swear they your lord by his patent stand bind to take his rouse long line the duchess the cause of this but yesterday the court wear the sad livery of distrust and fear no smile not in a buffoon to be see or common jester the great duke himself have sorrow in his face which wait on by his mother sister and his fair duchess disperse a silent mourning through all Milan as if some great blow have be give the state or be at least expect Stephano I know as you be noble you be honest and capable of secret of more weight then now I shall deliver if that Sforza the present duke though his whole life have be but one continue pilgrimage through danger affright and horror which his fortune guide by his strong judgement still have overcome appear now shake it deserve no wonder all that his youth have labour for the harvest sow by his industry ready to be reap to be now at the stake and all his hope confirm or lose for ever I know no such hazard the people well affect and so wise his provident care have wrought that though war rage in most part of our western world there be no enemy near we danger that we see to threaten ruin be with ease prevent but those strike deadly that come unexpected the lightning be far off yet soon as see we may behold the terrible effect that it produce but I|will help your knowledge and make his cause of fear familiar to you the war so long continue between the emperor Charles and Francis the french king have interest in either cause the most of the italian prince among which Sforza as one of great power be seek by both but with assurance have one his friend the other live his enemy it|be true and it|be a doubtful choice but he well know and have too it seem the spanish pride lend his assistance to the king of France which have so far incense the emperor that all his hope and honour be embark with his great patron fortune which stand fair for aught I yet can hear but shall it change the duke|be undo they have draw to the field two royal army full of fiery youth of equal spirit to dare and power to do so near entrench that it|be beyond all hope of human council they can ever be severe until it be determine by the sword who have the better cause for the success conclude the victor innocent and the vanquish most miserable guilty how uncertain the fortune of the war be child know and it be in suspense on who fair tent wing victory will make her glorious stand you can blame the duke though he appear perplex and trouble but why then in such a time when every knee shall bend for the success and safety of his person be these loud triumph in my weak opinion they be unseasonable I judge so too but only in the cause to be excuse it be the duchess birthday once a year solemnize with all pomp and ceremony in which the duke be not his own but she nay every day indeed he be her creature for never man so dote but to tell the ten part of his fondness to a stranger will argue i of fiction she|be indeed a lady of most exquisite form she know it and how to prize it I never hear she taint in any point of honour on my life she|be constant to his bed and well deserve his large favour but when beauty be stamp on great woman great in birth and fortune and blow by flatterer great than it be it|be seldom unaccompanied with pride nor be she that-way free presume on the duke affection and her own desert she bear herself with such a majesty look with scorn on all as thing beneath she that Sforza mother that will lose no part of what be once her own nor his fair sister a lady too acquaint with her worth will brook it well and howsoever their hate be smother for a time it|be more than fear it will at length break out he in who power

she be to admire she never wife meet with a pure heat her husband fervour a happy pair one in the other bless she confident in herself he|be whole she and can seek for change and he secure that it|be not in the power of man to tempt she and therefore to contest with she that be the strong and the better part of he be more than folly you know he of a nature not to be play with and shall you forget to obey he as your prince he|will not remember the duty that he owe you it|be but truth come clear our brow and let we to the banquet but not to serve his idol I shall do what may become the sister of a prince but will not stoop beneath it yet be wise soar not too high to fall but stoop to rise quick quick for love sake let the court put her choice outside cost and bravery on be only think of all
