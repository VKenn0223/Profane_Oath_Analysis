he cut i off aecius dies or I have lose myself why shall I kill he why shall I kill myself for it|be my kill aecius be my root and whither he like a decay branch I fall to nothing be he not more to i than wife than Cesar though I have now my safe revenge upon he be he not more than rumour and his friendship sweet than the love of woman what be honour we all so strange be bewitch withal can it relieve i if I want he have can honour betwixt the incense prince and envy bear up the life of worthy man he have can honour pull the wing of fearful coward and make they turn again like tiger he have and I have live to see this and preserve so why shall this empty word incite i then to what be ill and cruel let she perish a friend be more than all the world than honour she be a woman and her loss the less and with her go my grief but hark you maximus be she not you do she not die to tell you she be a ravish woman do not justice noble begin with she that not deserve it and shall you live that do it stay a little can this abuse die here shall not man tongue dispute it afterward and say I give affect dull obedience and tame duty and lead away with fondness of a friendship the only virtue of the world to slander be not this certain be not she a chaste one and such a one that no compare dwell with she one of so sweet a virtue that aecius even he himself this friend that hold i from it out of his worthy love to i and justice have it not be on Caesar he|have revenge she by heaven he tell i so what shall I do then enter a servant can other man affect it and I cold I fear he must not live my lord the general be come to seek you go entreat he to enter oh brave aecius I can wish thou now as far from friendship to i as from fear that I may cut thou off like that I weigh not be there no way without he to come near it for out of honesty he must destroy i if I attempt it he must die as other and I must lose he it|be necessity only the time and mean be all the difference but yet I will not make a murder of he take he direct for my doubt he shall die I have find a way to do it and a safe one it shall be honour to he too I know not what to determine certain I be so trouble and such a deal of conscience press i enter aecius will I be dead myself you run away well how get you from i friend that that lead mad man a strong imagination make i wander I think you have be more settle I be well but you must give i leave a little sometime to have a buzz in my brain you be dangerous but I|will prevent it if I can you tell i you will go to|the army why to have my throat cut must he not be the brave man aecius that strike i first you promise i a freedom from all these thought and why shall any strike you I be a enemy wicked one worse than the foe of Rome I be a coward a cuckold and a coward that|be two cause why every one shall beat i you be neither and dare another tell i so he die for|it for thus far on my honour I|will assure you no man more love than you and for your valour and what you may be fair no man more follow a doughty man indeed but that|be all one the emperor not all the prince live shall find a flaw in my coat I have suffer and can yet let they find infliction I|will find a body for they or I|will break it it|be not a wife can thrust i out some look for|it but let they look till they be blind with look they be but fool yet there be anger in i that I will fain disperse and now I think on|it you tell i friend the province be stir we shall have sport I hope then and what|be dangerous a battle shall beat from i why do you eye i with such a settle look
