can there be such a sudden change in court as you report be it to be believe that great Philotas who we all behold in grace last night shall be arraign today it can be and it be as I report for state of grace be no sure hold in court but yet it|be strange they shall be overthrow before their certain forfeiture be know tush it be breed long though sudden this thunder-crack come but to break out now the time I wait and I wait long until Philotas with some other lord depart the presence and as I conceive I never see the king in better mood nor yet Philotas ever in more grace can such storm grow and yet no cloud appear yea court storm grow when sky there seem most clear it be about the deep of the night the black hour of darkness and of sleep when with some other lord come Craterus fall down before the king entreat implore conjure his grace as ever he will look to save his person and the state from spoil now to prevent Philotas practise who they have plain find to be the man have plot the destruction of they all the king will fain have put they off to time and far day till better proof be know which they perceive press he still the more and reinforce his danger and their own and never leave he till they have obtain commission to|apprehend Philotas straight now to make fear look with more hideous face or else but to beget it out of form and careful preparation of distrust about the palace man in armour watch in armour man about the king attend all passage and issue be forelay with horse to|interrupt whatever news shall hence break out into parmenio camp I with three hundred man in armour charge have warrant to attach and to commit the person of Philotas present and come to his lodging where he lie find he embury in the sound sleep that ever man can be where neither noise of clatter weapon or our rush in with rude and trample rumour can dissolve the heavy humour of that drowsy brow which hold perhaps his sense now more fast as loath to leave because it be the last Attarras what can treason sleep so sound will that loud hand of horror that still beat upon the guilty conscience of distrust permit it to|have so resolute a rest I can tell but thus we find he there nor can we I assure you waken he till thrice I call he by his name and thrice have shake he hard and then at length he wake and look on i with a settle cheer dear friend Attarras what|be the news say he what up so soon to hasten the remove or raise by some alarm or some distrust I tell he that the king have some distrust why what will Nabarzanes play say he the villain with the king as he have do already with his miserable lord I see he will or do not understand his own distress tell he the charge I have wherewith he rise and rise use these word oh Alexander now I see my foe have get above thy goodness and prevail against my innocency and thy word and as we then enchain and fetter he look on that base furniture of shame poor body say he have so many alarm raise thou to blood and danger from thy rest to|inve thou with this armour now at last be this the service I be call to now but we that be not to attend his plaint cover his head with a disgraceful weed take and convey he sudden to ward from whence he shall|be instant bring forth here to be|arraign before the king who sit accord to the macedonian use in case capital himself as judge well then I see who be so high above be never to lightning that be never to jove the heinous treason of some few have like to|have rent i from you worthy soldier but by the mercy of the|immortal god I live and joy your sight your reverend sight which make i more to|abhor those parricide not for my own respect but for the wrong you have receive if their design have stand since I desire but life to do you good but how will you be move when you shall know who be the man that do attempt this shame when I shall show that which I grieve to show and name such as will God I can not name but that the foulness of their practice now blot out all memory of what they be and though I will suppress they yet I know this shame of they will never but appear Parmenio be the man a man you see bind by so many merit both to i and to my father our ancient friend a man of year experience gravity who wicked minister Philotas be who here Demetrius luculaus and this Dymnus who dead body here you see with other have suborn to slaughter i And here come Metron with Nichomacus to who this murder wretch at first reveal the project of this whole conspiracy to|aver as much as be disclose to he Nichomacus look here advise thou well what do thou know this man that here lie dead my sovereign lord I know he very well it be one Dymnus who do three day since bewray to i a treason practise by he and other to have slay your grace where or by who or when do he report this wicked act shall be accomplish he say within three day your majesty shall be within your chamber murder by special man of the nobility of who he many name and they be these loceus Demetrius and Archelopis Nicanor and Amyntas luculous droceus with aphebaetus and himself thus much his brother Ceballinus do reveal to i from out this youth report and so much with the circumstance of all do I unto Philotas intimate then what have be his mind who do suppress the information of so foul a train yourselves my worthy soldier well may guess which Dymnus death declare not to be vain poor Ceballinus not a moment stay to redischarge himself of such a weight Philotas careless fearless nothing weigh nor aught reveal his silence show deceit and tell he be content it shall be do which though he be no party make he one for he that know upon what power he stand and see his father greatness and his own see nothing in the way which now withstand his vast desire but only this my crown which in respect that I be issueless he think the rather easy to be|attain but yet Philotas be deceive in this I have who shall inherit all I gain in you I have both child kindred friend you be the heir of all my purchase and while you live I be not issueless and that these be not shadow of my fear for I fear nought but want of enemy see what this intercept letter bear and how Parmenio do his son advice this show their end hold read it Craterus my son first have a special care unto yourselves then unto those which do depend on you so shall you do what you intend to do see but how close he write that if these line shall come unto his son as they be send they may encourage they in their design if enterprise may mock the ignorant but now you see what be the thing be mean you see the father care the son intent and what if he as a conspirator be not by Dymnus name among the rest that show not his innocence but his power who they account too great to be suppress and rather will accuse themselves then he for that while he shall live there|be hope for they and how he|have bear himself in private sort I will not stand to urge it|be too well know nor what have be his arrogant report to|embase my action and to brag his own nor how he mock my letter which I write to show he of the style bestow on i by the|oracle of jove these thing I think but weakness and word of vanity yet word that read the ulcer of his heart which I suppress and never cease to yield the chief reward of worth and still compart the best degree and honour of the field in hope to win his love yet now at length there have I danger where I look for strength I will to God my blood have rather be pour out the offering of a enemy then practise to be shed by one of i that one of i shall have this infamy have I be so reserve from fear to fall there where I ought not to have fear at all have you so oft advise i to regard the safety which you see i run from when with some hot pursuit I press hard my foe abroad to perish thus at home but now that safety only rest in you which you so oft have wish i look unto and now unto your bosom must I fly without who will I will not wish to live and with your will I can less I give due punishment unto this treachery Attarras bring the hateful prisoner forth this traitor which have seek to|undo we all to give we up to slaughter and to make our blood a scorn here in a barbarous land that none of we shall have return back unto our native country to our wife our age parent kindred and our friend to make the body of this glorious host a most deform trunk without a head without the life or soul to guide the same o thou base traitor impious parricide who make i loathe the blood that match with thou and if I may but have my will I vow thou shall not die by other hand than i fie Caenus what a barbarous course be this he first must to his accusation plead and have his trial formal to our law and let he make the best of his bad cause Philotas here the macedonian be to judge your fact what language will thou use the persian language if it please your grace for that beside the macedonian here be many that will better understand if I shall use the speech your grace have use which be I hold unto no other end but that the most man here may understand see how his native language he disdain but let he speak at large as he desire so long as you remember he do hate beside the speech our glory and the state Black be the colour lay upon the crime wherewith my faith stand charge my worthy lord that as behind in fortune so in time I come too late to clear the same with word my condemnation be go out before my innocency and my just defence and take up all your heart and leave no door for my excuse to have a entrance that destitute of all compassion now betwixt a upright conscience of desert and a unjust disgrace I know not how to satisfy the time and my own heart authority look with so stern a eye upon this woeful bar and must have still such a advantage over misery as that it will make good all that it will he who shall only judge my cause be go and why he will not stay I do not see since when my cause be hear his power alone as well may then condemn as set i free nor can I by his absence now be clear who presence have condemn i thus unheard and though the grievance of a prisoner tongue may both superfluous and disgraceful seem which do not sue but show the judge his wrong yet pardon i I must not disesteem my rightful cause for be despise nor must forsake myself though I be left of all fear can make my innocence unjust unto itself to give my truth the fall and I have rather see how my fortune draw my word shall be deform then my cause I know that nothing be more delicate than be the sense and feel of a state the clap the bruit the fear but of a hurt in king behalf thrust with that violence the subject will to prosecute report as they condemn ere they discern the|offence Philotas you deceive yourself in this that think to win compassion and belief by|impugn justice and to make man guess we do you wrong out of our heat of grief or that our place or passion do lay more on your misfortune than your own desert or have not well discern your fact before or will without due proof your state subvert these be the usual theme of traitor tongue who practise mischief and complain of wrong your treason be too manifest know to mask in other livery than their own think not that we be set to charge you here with bare suspicion but with open fact and with a treason that appear as clear as be the sun and know to be your act what be this treason who accuse i the process of the whole conspiracy but where|be the man that name i to be one here this dead traitor show you to be one how can he dead accuse i of the same who live he nor do nor yet can name but we can other testimony show from those who be your chief complice I be not too be|adjudge in law you know by testimony but by witness no testimonijs sine testibsu let they be here produce unto my face that can avouch I|a party in this case my lord and fellow soldier if of those who Dymnus nominate any one out of his torture will a word disclose to show I be a party I have do think not so great a number ever will endure their torment and themselves accuse and leave i out since man in such case still will rather slander other than excuse calamity malignant be and he that suffer just for his guiltiness ease his own affliction but to see other torment in the same distress and yet I fear not whatsoever they by rack and torture can be forest to say have I be one will Dymnus have conceal my name be hold to be the principal will he not for his glory have reveal the best to he to who he must tell all nay if he false then have name i one to grace himself must I of force be one Alas if Ceballinus have not come to i and give i note of this conspiracy I have not stand here now but be as free from question as I be from treachery that be the only cloud that thunder on my disgrace which have I deem true or can but have divine of Dymnus death Philotas have my lord sit therewith you my fault be to have be too credulous wherein I show my weakness I confess Philotas what a monarch and confess your imperfection and your weakness o Craterus do not insult upon calamity it be a barbarous grossness to lay on the weight of scorn where heavy misery too much already way man fortune down for if the cause be ill I undergo the law and not reproach must make it so there|be no reproach can ever be too much to lay on traitor who desert be such Men use the most reproach where they fear the cause will better prove then their desire but sir a traitor cause that be so clear as this of you will never need that fear I be no traitor but suspect one for not believe a conspiracy and mere suspect by law condemn none they be approve fact for which man die the law in treason do the will correct with like severeness as it do the|effect the|affection be the essence of the|offence the execution only but the|accidence to have but will it be to|have do the same I do not err in will but in belief and if that be a traitor then be I the chief yea but your will make your belief consent to hide the|practise till the|accomplishment belief turn not by motion of our will and it be but the event that make that ill some fact man may excuse though not defend where will and fortune have a diverse end the|example of my father make i fear to be too forward to relate thing hear who write to the king wish he forbear the potion his physician have prepare for that he hear Darius tempt have his faith with many talent to be|untrue and yet his drug in the|end not prove bad do make my father care seem more than due for oft by a untimely diligence a busy faith may give a prince offence so that what shall we do if we reveal we be despise suspect if conceal and as for this wherever now thou be oh Alexander thou have pardon i thou have already give i thy hand the earnest of thy reconcile heart and therefore now o let thy goodness stand unto thy word and be thou as thou be if thou believe i then I be absolve if pardon i these fetter be dissolve what have I else deserve since yesternight when at thy table I such grace do find what heinous crime have since be bring to light to wrong my faith and to divert thy mind that from a restful quiet most profound sleep in my misfortune make secure both by thy hand and by a conscience sound I must be wake for gyve for robe impure for all disgrace that on i wrath can lay and see the worst of shame ere I see day when I least think that other cruelty shall have wrought more than thou own clemency Philotas whatsoever gloss you lay upon your rot cause it be in vain your pride your carriage ever do bewray your discontent your malice and disdain you can palliate mischief but it will through all the fair cover of deceit be always see we know those stream of ill flow from that head that feed they with conceit you foster malcontent you entertain all humour you all faction must embrace you vaunt your own exploit and you disdain the king proceed and his style disgrace you promise mountain and you draw man on with hope of great good then have be see you brag of late that something will be do whereby your concubine shall be a queen and now we see the thing that shall be do but God be praise we see you first undo ah do not make my nature if it have so pliable a stern of disposition to turn to every kindness to be bad for do good to man of all condition make not you charity to|interpret all be do for favour to be do for show and that we in our bounty prodigal upon our end not on man need bestow let not my one day error make you tell that all my life-time I do never well and that because this fall out to be ill that what I do do tend unto this ill it be unjust to join to|a present fact more of time past then it have ever have before to do withal as if it lack sufficient matter to make it bad I do confess indeed I write something against this title of the son of jove and that not of the king but to the king I freely use these word out of my love and thereby have that dangerous liberty of speak truth with trust on former grace betray my meaning unto enmity and draw a argument of my disgrace so that I see though I speak what I ought it be not in that manner as I ought and God forbid that ever soldier word shall be make liable unto misdeed when faint in their march tire in the fight sick in their tent stop their wound that bleed or haut and jolly after conquest goat they shall out of their heat use word unkind their deed deserve to have they rather think the passion of the season than their mind for soldier joy or wrath be measureless rapt with a instant motion and we blame we hate we praise we pity in excess accord as our present passion flame sometime to pass the ocean we will feign sometime to other world and sometime slack and idle with our conquest entertain a sullen humour of return back all which conceit one trumpet sound do end and each man run to his rank do lose what in our tent dislike we and we spend all that conceive wrath upon our foe and word if they proceed of levity be to be scorn of madness pity if out of malice or of injury to be remiss or unacknowledged for of themselves they vanish by disdain but if pursue they will be think not vain but word accord to the person way if his design be heinous so be they they be the tinder of sedition still wherewith you kindle fierce inflame man will Craterus you have the|advantage of the day the law be you to say what you will say and yet do all your gloss but bear the sense only of my misfortune not offence have I pretend mischief to the king can not I have effect it without Dimnus do not my free access bring continual mean to|have bring the same about be not I since I hear the thing descry alone and arm in private with his grace what hinder i that then I have not try to|have do that mischief have time and place Philotas even the providence above protectress of the sacred state of king that never suffer treachery to have good council never in this case but bring confusion to the actor do undo your heart in what you go about to do but yet despair we see do thrust man on see no way else to|undo ere be undo that same despair do likewise let man fall in that amaze they can do nought at all well well my lord my service have make know the faith I owe my sovereign and the state Philotas forwardness have ever show unto all nation at how high a rate I prize my king and at how low my blood to do he honour and my country good we blame not what you|have be but what you be we accuse not here your valour but your fact not to have be a leader in the war but a ill subject in a wicked act although we know thrust rather with the love of your own glory then with duty lead you have do much yet all your course prove you tide still your achievement to the head of your own honour when it have be meet you have they lay down at your sovereign foot God give to king the honour to command to subject all their glory to obey who ought in time of war as rampier stand in peace as the|ornament of state array the king have recompense your service with better love than you show thankfulness by grace he make you great than you be by nature you receive that which he be not tide to give to you his gift be far more dear than all you do in make you employ but say your service have deserve at all this one offence have make it odious all and therefore here in vain you use that mean to plead for life which you have conceal clean my lord you far mistake i if you deem I plead for life that poor weak blast of breath from which so oft I run with light esteem and so well have acquaint i with death no no my lord it be not that I fear it be my honour that I seek to clear and which if my disgrace cause will let the language of my heart be understand be all which I have ever seek to get and which oh leave i now and take my blood let not your envy go beyond the bound of what you seek my life stand in your way that be your aim take it and do not wound my reputation with that wrong I pray if I must needs be make the sacrifice of envy and that no oblation will the wrath of king but only blood suffice yet let i have something leave that be not ill be there no way to get unto our life but first to have our honour overthrow Alas though grace of king all greatness give it can give we virtue that|be our own though all be they our heart and hand can do yet that by which we do be only we the trophy that our blood erect unto their memory to glorify their power let they enjoy yet only to have do worthy of grace let not that be undo let that high swell river of their fame leave humble stream that feed they yet their name oh my dear father do thou bring that spirit those hand of valour that so much have do in this great work of Asia this to merit by do worthy to be undo and have thou make this purchase of thy sword to get so great a empire for thy lord and so disgrace a grave for thou and thou to|extinguish by thy service all thy line one of thy son by be to valorous but five day since yet o well lose his breath thy dear Nicanor the|half arch of thy house and here now the other at the bar of death stand overcharge with wrath in far worse case and be to be confound with disgrace thyself must give the|acquittance of thy blood for other debt to who thou have do good which if they will a little time afford death will have take it without a sword such the reward of great employment be hate kill in peace who fortune spare in war and this be that high grace of king we seek who favour and who wrath consume a like Lo here the misery of king who cause however just it be however strong yet in respect they may their greatness draw the world to think they ever do the wrong but this foul fact of you you stand upon Philotas shall beside the|apparency which all the world see plain ere we have do by your own mouth be make to satisfy the most stiff partialist that will not see my mouth will never prove so false I trust unto my heart to show itself unjust and what I here do speak I know my lord I speak with my own mouth but other where what may be say I say may be the word not of my breath but fame that oft do err let the|oracle of Ammon be enquire about this fact who if it shall be true will never suffer those who have conspire against jove son to|escape without their due but will reveal the truth or if this shall not seem convenient why then lay on all the torture that may force a tongue to tell the secret thought that can imagine ill what need we send to know more than we know that be to give you time to|acquaint your friend with your estate till some combustion grow within the camp to hasten on your end and that the gold and all the treasury commit to your father custody in Media now may arm his desperate troop to come upon we and to cut our throat what shall we ask of jove that which he have reveal already but let|we send to give thank that by he the king have scape the wrath of thou disloyal traitor and do live let|we tear the wretch in piece let we rend with our own hand the traitorous parricide peace Belon silence love soldier you see my lord out of your judgment grave that all excuse sickly colour have and he that have thus false and faithless be must find out other god and other man who to forswear and who he may deceive no word of he can make we more believe his impudence and therefore see it|be late we till the morning do dismiss the court
