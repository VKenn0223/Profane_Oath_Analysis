general absence soon will wake the eye of the suspicious soldier be my lord in readiness I have no other way yet this be rough and justice whisper it|be unsafe to tread it if to love she be sinful what be I How dare I call his passion to the bar and nourish it myself why may not he who have as bold a fortune entertain as bold a love and in the fate of war have outgo by service why not then present it to the selfsame altar but we can harbour both in the same port or he or I be shipwreck for the storm be raise and to appease it death must be the sacrifice my lord here be the second this stranger dare not meet with your great spirit suspect he not my lord he have a courage above the sense of fear well sir your answer my lord Ascanio can have wish his life may have be destine to a happy purpose And charge i tell your lordship that he have much rather have be lose with common dust in the cheap churchyard than endanger fame in this great duel he call to his sad thought the mischief which this kingdom needs must fall into when you shall perish by his sword certain you can escape it thus provoke death then to what ruin may the queen who safety you both have labour be engage he can with patience almost suffer on his name the infamy of coward rather than hazard the quiet of her estate but you let i consider it|be a idle rage that heat i to this quarrel let her fate remain unshake though she choose my foe into her love and bosom if she live above the fear of ruin I be mighty mighty enough though by my grief grow feeble and weaken too disease fright the healthy I

fortune crown his temple with or perish in the attempt my fate decree it why do he turn his face away as if he dare not look on danger do his fear now triumph over his courage he|be more than mortal sure he strike like lightning himself not passive but I|will try again and disenchant the sorcerer I there I reach he home you bleed open your doublet the wound perhaps be dangerous sure I have hear that voice and see that face Velasco it|be the king some planet strike i dead and fix this arm a monument to tell posterity the treason of my error mighty sir show mercy to your creature that my death
