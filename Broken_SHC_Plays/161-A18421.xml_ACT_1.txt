scalp of any courtier a fellow only that consist of sinew mere Swisser apt for any execution but kill of the king right now I see thou understand thyself I and you better you be a king son bear right and a king brother true and may not any fool have be so too as well as you a pox upon you you do not princely deed ere you|be bear I take it to deserve it nor do you any since that I have hear nor will do ever any as all think the devil take he I|will no more of he nay stay my lord and hear he answer you no more I swear farewell no more ill fortune I will have give a million to have hear his scoff retort and the insolence of his high birth and greatness which be never effect of his desert but of his fortune make show to his dull eye beneath the worth that man aspire to by their know virtue without which greatness be a shade a bubble but what one great man dream of that but you all take their birth and birthright leave to they acquire by other for their own worth purchase when many a fool in both be great as they and who will think they can win with their worth wealthy possession when win to their hand they neither can judge just of their value nor know their use and therefore they be puff with such proud tumour as this monsieur be enable only by the good they have to scorn all goodness none great fill their fortune but as those man that make their house great their household be less so fortune raise huge heap of outside in these mighty man and give they nothing in they true as truth and therefore they have rather drown their substance in superfluity of brick and stone like Sisyphus advance of they ever and ever pull down then lay the cost of any sluttish corner on a man build with God finger and enstile his temple it|be noble say my lord I will have these thing bring upon stage to let mighty miser see all their grave and serious misery play as once they be in Athens and old Rome nay we must now have nothing bring on stage but puppetry and pied ridiculous antic man thither come to laugh and feed fool-fat check at all goodness there as be profane when wheresoever goodness come she make the place still sacred though with other foot never so much it|be scandal and pollute let i learn any thing that fit a man in any stable show as well as stage why be not all the world esteem a stage yes and right worthy and stage too have a respect due to they if but only for what the good greek moralist say of they be a man proud of greatness or of riches give i a expert actor I|will show all that can within his great glory fall be a man afraid with poverty and lowness give i a actor I|will show every eye what he lament so and so much do fly the best and worst of both if but for this then to make the proud outside that most swell with thing without he and above his worth see how small cause he have to be so blow up and the most poor man to be grieve with poorness both be so easy bear by expert actor the stage and actor be not so contemptful as every innovate Puritan and ignorant sweater out of zealous envy will have the world imagine and beside that all thing have be liken to the mirth use upon stage and for stage fit the splenative philosopher that ever laugh at they all be worthy the enstage all object be they never so full of tear he so conceit that he can distil thence matter that still feed his ridiculous humour hear he a lawyer never so vehement plead he stand and laugh hear he a tradesman swear never so thrifty sell of his ware he stand and laugh hear he a holy brother for hollow ostentation at his prayer never so impetuous he stand and laugh see he a great man never so insult severe inflict grave give law not for their good but he he stand and laugh see he a youthful widow never so weep wring of her hand for her lose lord still the philosopher laugh now whether he suppose all these presentment be only maskery and wear false face or else be simple vain I take no care but still he laugh how grave soever they be and may right well my Clermont and for this virtuous digression we will thank the scoff of vicious monsieur but now for the main point of your late resolution for revenge of your slay friend I have here my challenge which I will pray my brother Baligny to bear the murderous earl I have prepare mean for access to he through all his guard about it then my worthy Baligny and bring we the success I will my lord revenge that ever red sit in the eye of injure lady till we crown thy brow with bloody laurel and receive from thou justice for all our humour injury who wing none fly that

steel footstep here oh here where still earth move with pity yield and embrace my love fair figure draw in his dear blood and mark the place to show thou where be do the cruel murder that ere flee the sun o earth why keep thou not as well his spirit to give his form life no that be not earthly that rarefy the thin and yield air fly sparkle up into the sphere of fire whence endless flame it shed in my desire here be my daily pallet here all night that can be wrest from thy rivals arm oh my dear Bussy I will lie and kiss spirit into thy blood or breathe out i in sigh and kiss and sad tune to thou

only for thy lust a little cover with a veil of shame look out for fresh life rather then witchlike learn to kiss horror and with death engender strange cross in nature pure virgin shame lie in the blood as lust lie and together many time mix too and in none more shameful than in the shamefaced who can then distinguish betwixt their affection or tell when he meet with one not common yet as worthy poet shun common and plebeian form of speech every illiberal and affect phrase to clothe their matter and together tie matter and form with art and decency so worthy woman shall shun vulgar guise and though they can but fly out for change yet modesty the matter of their life be it adulterate shall be paint true with modest outpart what they shall do still grace with good show though deed be never so ill that be so far from all you seek of we that though yourselves be common as the air we must not take the air we must not fit our action to our own affection but as geometrician you still say teach that no line nor superficies do move themselves but still accompany the motion of their body so poor wife must not pursue nor have their own affection but to their husband earnest and their jest to their austerity of look and laughter though never so foolish and injurious like parasite and slave fit their disposure I use thou as my soul to move and rule i So say you when you woo so soldier torture with tedious siege of some well-walled town propound condition of most large content freedom of law all former government but have once set foot within the wall and get the reins of

Remember their desert those with fair warning may have be reform not these unmanly rage you have hear the fiction of the north wind and the sun both work on a traveller and contend which have most power to take his cloak from he which when the wind attempt he roar out outrageous blast at he to force it off that wrap it close on when the calm sun the wind once leave charge he with still beam quiet and fervent and therein be constant which make he cast off both his cloak and coat like who shall man do if you wish your wife shall leave dislike thing seek it not with rage for that enrage what you give you have but use calm warning and kind manly mean and that in wife most prostitute will win not only sure amends but make we wife better than those that never lead faulty life my lord
