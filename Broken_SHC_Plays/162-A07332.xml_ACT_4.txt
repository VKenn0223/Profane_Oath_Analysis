god extend their narrow providence and show their power in wood and rural village yet think the imperial family of Rome not worth their care at all for if they have where sleep their justice when great Claudius be murder by his servant and his wife and they adore and honour by the state for act that accurse deed what right can all the subject world receive from thence what good can dwell upon

youth it|be true Narcissus I of late have hear many begin to fear the prophecy of Aenobarbus his detest sire Xiphilin that nothing good can be beget betwixt he and Agrippina too too true alas such prophecy of some of our late prince have prove to Rome as that Augustus make of the slow-jawed Tiberius and Tiberius of his successor Caius who he name a Phaeton to the unhappy world all that I hope for be a wretched life if that be not too much for i to hope into Campania will I go but there if death pursue i Caesar arm be long and I be arm for any accident let none but with a spirit prepare to

there no other cause be crime enough he be descend in the same degree that Nero be from great Augustus loin and some have late whisper that his age be more mature for sovereignty than Nero beside thou know his brother Lucius that shall have marry young Octavia by we be hunt to his death and he may meditate revenge you need not fear a spirit so sluggish as Silanus be your brother Caius Caesar in the midst of all his fear and jealousy to which he sacrifice so many noble branch of your imperial house contemn Silanus as one in who there be no spirit or danger and call he nothing but the golden beast we can tell if time of trouble come how much that beast by courage of attendant and confluence of soldier may be change he be proconsul now of Asia and may here after if the people shall malign our government bring power against we if you will have it so Publius celerius and Aelius now go for Asia have undertake there to poison he let it be do but Pallas first of all let a centurion be dispatch into Campania to kill Narcissus there Xiphilin he must not live that do contrive our ruin and know I fear the mean by which we escape it by our command it shall be warrant but tell i Pallas ere thou

the pleasure of this happy age dull satyr such as water or the lees of tuscan wine beget let they admire those old penurious time when Curius feed on leek and onion when Fabritius feast the frugal senate with hang beef and rusty bacon and in earthen pot drink small etrurian wine let they be still such as themselves will make themselves unworthy to taste the plenty that Rome now enjoy why do our fame ancestor so far extend their conquer arm and strive to get the riches of the world but that their nephew may now enjoy they it|be ingratitude to their rich labour shall we scorn to use what they have get or if the use of it in we be riot sure it|be avarice in they that toil so much to purchase it which of those rigid censor that declaim against the vice of the time and tax Rome as luxurious now will call it virtue in a rich citizen who storehouse be fraught with the best provision his chest crowd his cellar full of rich campanian wine yet he himself to drink the course lees to feed on acorn pulse and crab to wrong his nature and defraud his genius it|be say the fury keep pine Tantalus from taste those delicious fruit he see such will the Roman virtue be shall she affright her son the master of the world from taste that which they themselves possess it|be true those former age be most frugal we thank they for|it the better be our fare let those that list now when they have no

immediate may fetch Poppaea hither to the banquet it shall be do this ring will fetch she hither I ever though it|will come to this thy plot of bring act in I see have fail thou will not frown my act though thou see another beauty here no royal Caesar nor shall you hear i envious or detract although I know Poppaea be a lady who beauty do as far excel poor act as Cynthia do the lesser star or Venus the other sea-nymph here you shall find the saying do not hold that woman be detractor from each other so please it Caesar to great Augusta Agrippina health let it go round and now Petronius I come to thou I do command thou write a satire present against those pleasure thou do so late praise against the attire and costly diet of this notorious age this be thy task I must obey the king and now|be the fit time for such a satire I never find my virtue of that strength as to contemn good victual but upon a well fill stomach I|have write already a satiric poem in a grave angry way where I complain that Rome excess corruption luxury ruin the present government and betwixt Caesar and Pompey cause a civil war listen and hear my castigation now all the world victorious Rome have win all land all

Petronius a man may write a satire and yet be no Scaurus Curius or Fabritius a satirist shall be the contrary and know those vice which he mean to tax brother Britannicus thy task be next stand up and sing a song give i some time I can do|it extempore what subject then give i leave to sing my own misfortune how I come to lose the roman sceptre how that will not fit a feast of mirth this must not be endure I must be free from this continual fear then be excuse be merry gentleman I wonder Anicetus stay so long but see they come be this Poppaea Otho wonder of her sex bright paragon of Rome all beauty yet that I have see have be but foil to set a great lustre on this star of light his eye be fix his change look do speak a depth of passion or my jealous fear dazzle my eye too much it|be so she|be lose if ever lady be a tennis ball it|be this she|be bandy so from one to other must then another reap the envy fruit of my injustice must Poppaea be my crime that take she from her other lord to be his pleasure no Otho still she show more fair and fair I can check my love sit fair lady and with your lustre grace our feast I see thou be a most incomparable judge in beauty otho and be I to choose a wife again I|will trust no eye but thou but tell i thy opinion in one question which do thou think the noble in a prince if he will use his power and do a act that may be think unjust to do|it for friendship or satisfaction of his own delight Sr. have you make the case a private man for the delight of prince as themselves we must count sacred I can soon resolve it I think it noble then to do|it for friendship for friendship ever be hold honourable but satisfaction of our own delight a thing of weakness rather than of honour Augustus Caesar then and I by power have do the self same act but in the cause I have excel Augustus for he to satisfy his own hot love from Claudius Nero take fair Livia I from Crispinus take a bright beauty to show myself no lover but a friend do not mistake i Otho and suppose I do repent the favour I have do I know it|be well bestow it|be such a favour that I confess great Caesar as no tongue can be enough expressive so it|be hard to find a heart that|be large enough to pay sufficient thanks in thought but pious man have still acknowledge that no thanks of we can equalise the bounty of the god and prince be like they shall I think less I shall both wrong the giver and the gift in value she aright thou show thyself as wise as just I wish thou joy of she but fair lady since it be so late before you grace our feast I can think that I have entertain you yet at all the scene shall therefore change another room shall bid Poppaea welcome to the court the god continue it but Vitellius I fear the sequel Agrippina fierce and haughty disposition will too much provoke her son it|be think and he too forward to throw all nature off I think so too and therefore I can wish that Agrippina will go a gentle way she must not build too much upon her merit though we know it|be she that put the sceptre in his hand for vicious nature where they once begin to take distaste and purpose no requital the great debt they owe the more they hate beside she|will find it hard far to work her end upon a son than it|be to rule a dote husband time will show it all and we ere long shall know which way to lean will Agrippina sit today with Caesar on his tribunal to give audience to those armenian ambassador there be no doubt she will but I have spoil that state I hope for I have counsel Nero that if she come he shall arise and meet she as if he do it in respect and duty defer the|audience of the|ambassador I hope she will not understand our drift it will be Rome disgrace the senate shame and my great crime if the ambassador that come to plead their country cause at Rome shall see a woman perch up with Caesar into the chare to give they audience and sit command over the roman ensign it|be not the custom of our ancestor to see such sight true Lucius Seneca our ancestor have no such kind of woman she in her heart|be a man and you mistake if you esteem she only Caesar mother not his colleague and partner in the empire or more than so I be not so ingrateful to hate the woman since I know it be her favour that repeal my banishment but I dislike these thing that foreign state in her unseemly carriage shall behold Xiphilin the shame of Rome and will she keep a temper fit the quality of her sex and place I shall admire the bravery of her mind long live great Nero Caesar the chief care of heaven and high sovereign of the earth the prince of Armenia Vologese and Tiridates greet your majesty by we and do congratulate the honour which since divine Claudius leave the earth to make a god in|heaven be fall on you and to your high tribunal do refer the controversy that be now betwixt they my mother|be come defer the|embassador as it|be appoint Seneca wherefore rise Caesar from his tribunal when affair of state be bring before he no respect can be too much for i to give great Agrippina excuse i Caesar if it be respect it|be now unseasonable take your seat I|will fit with you myself and here the|affair of these armenian ambassador we have defer the business a while and think upon a fit time to hear it if you arise because the audience be end or defer upon just reason it|be not respect to i that make you rise as you allege at first but I have find it the reason that defer this audience be Agrippina come I see thou blush Nero and may just to call that reverence which be affront be a dissemble not befit Caesar and to affront a mother so deserve be not the duty that befit Nero can near Agrippina think she Nero will ever do a act that may be judge affront to she this be thou know it Nero and so do thy adviser Seneca from he it come no other senator dare to have counsel my disgrace but he never will Seneca so much oblige to Agrippina royal favour wish or council her disgrace o Seneca philosophy never teach ingratitude if you have think the place unfit for i you may have tell i private before not use this trick which howsoever it hold in stoicism I|be sure be nought in state her spirit can brook the least appearance of a injury Caesar I|will leave thou now nor shall my presence be any hindrance to thy state affair for Seneca I|will short teach he new philosophy she|be full of anger but it move not i since what I do be just and for the honour of Rome and Caesar honest action will be enough protection to themselves ah noble Burrhus it must be hereafter our great care to curb that woman pride and what we can remove she from all rule and government of state for Agrippina be of too hot and fierce a disposition what shall we do it|be pity to incense her son against she the god forbid that we shall strive to make the prince unnatural but to prevent this inconvenience I will persuade young Caesar not with purpose to wrong his mother somewhat to abate her dangerous greatness to remove from her part of her guard of German soldier and to displace her wicked counsellor that insolent and lordly freedman Pallas you need not use persuasion to your pupil the god forgive it if I judge amiss to stand against his mother I much fear he will too quick hate she for no reason to state belong but because she grow imperious over he and strive to curb his lust and riot those those Seneca I fear be seed of future tyranny and for his love as if the fate decree to make his passion all preposterous his virtuous wife noble Octavia the only instance in this wicked age of woman great and good be loathe by he that most afflict i can we find a cure for that disease all other malady a ripe age will in some part redress and I will strive to change they by degree and get he to forsake his loose associate but let we first endeavour to remove fierce Agrippina from all rule of state shall I that be a emperor be check control and baffle in my palace thus I will remove this mother far from i and give command to Burrhus to provide that house that be Antonia for she the palace shall be free to my delight I make no doubt but that the people know and hate her pride and will the less repine at what I do against she I have tell she for she provoke i past all patience part of my mind already she shall rue perchance too late the fierceness she have show ingrateful Nero be thy mother power so soon offensive grow can thou so soon cast off all filial duty and forget what I deserve from thou will thou deprive i of all power that give all power to thou do I so wicked for thou procure the height of human state that thou shall take all state from i with great wickedness o wrong Claudius this sad punishment my bloody treason and ingratitude to thy offend mane just pay by the most love and most injure lord the worst of wife be more belove than now the best of mother by a wicked son I|will make he know what hand it be that raise his fortune to this height but wherefore weep my dear Octavia what accurse fate pursue the woeful claudian family be I bestow or rather lose in marriage to advance upon my brother ruin Nero state to be by he despise hate and make a base freed-woman slave act thy Nero concubine my mistress that dare within the palace to contest nay to revile Octavia she dare not nor shall she do|it I|will slit the strumpet nose if she dare speak against thou you can mother Nero delight in none but she his soul in act live on she he do bestow that love that|be due to i but i he loathe o dismal love o fatal marriage take comfort sweet Octavia I|will redress thy wrong or venture my own fall with thou you have complain I see Octavia be there a chide towards have thy guilt and the unkind wrong thou have already do unthankful Nero to thy virtuous wife arm thou with such a impudence that now thou can prevent she just accuse thus methinks although thou have no spark of goodness leave thou yet in policy thou shall not dare maintain a base bear strumpet against thy lawful wife great Claudius daughter methinks in policy you may remember you speak to Caesar not a child it|be true thou have forget the duty of a child I will be better know if I be cross in my delight I will be bold to cross you in your pleasure too o heaven what pleasure what joy or study have I ever have but to prefer thou Nero be my care and all my labour thus requite now let not too vain and foolish confidence of what thou be make thou presume to wrong thy mother and thy wife or thou shall know the empire lawful heir be yet alive the wrong Britannicus be grow up to take his right and to revenge the wrong which he and all his family sustain Xiphilin I|will go myself to the praetorian camp and plead his cause before the soldier there let one-handed Burrhus and that base unthankful exile Seneca appear against the daughter of Germanicus yes plead the cause of young Britannicus and when you have do provide a advocate to plead your own go so abrupt from we slight he my anger so madam I fear you take too harsh a way his look be wild and full of rage my sad misgive soul tell i some mischief|be work in his thought fear not Octavia we|will take the best and sure course to prevent the ill that may ensue and if mature advice and council can bridle he we|will use another mean to curb his insolence I have already by my bounty make most of the tribune and centurion my guard be strong and shall be vigilant over the safety of Britannicus as my own person there|be no open act of mischief can be on the sudden wrought my fear have be too slow and it|be high time that Agrippina thunder threat have wake my sleep mischief which shall now no more study disguise but appear in bold and open act with Caesar stamp upon they fearless of vulgar whisper jealousy upon thy death Britannicus a price no less than Rome imperial wreath be set the deed when do will privilege itself and make the power of Nero strong enough to warrant his misdeed who dare revenge or blame the offence that free i from a rival but I shall leave a worse and near far behind my mother Agrippina live she live my rival nay my partner still nay more than that my queen and governess I be no prince no man nothing at all while Agrippina live must 〈◊〉 then live to make i nothing must the name of mother outweigh a sceptre can the name of husband protect she Claudius no her own example shall teach i state but first Britannicus must be remove his death assure my state and make i able to contest with she that gentle poison which Locusta give he if poison it|be while we do vain fear the people talk have keep my fear alive where be this hag witch beat she fiend fury devil I|will hew thy curse carcase into atom thou give Britannicus a antidote in stead of poison it|be a gentle poison and such as you command i to make hold Caesar hold I will redeem all yet do it or die make i a poison strong a quick and speed one it shall be do no soon taste but it shall destroy I|will see the trial of it and reward thy service well but if Britannicus out live this day this day shall be thy last the prince begin his reign most hopeful do you not wonder how I bear it thus I must confess the loss be wondrous great I|will put she from my thought farewell Narcissus may the god protect thou exeunt Otho another after otho yes a three what shall he be ha Caesar This Caesar that now live Shee be unworthy of great Caesar sight I know none envy i I care not much he will at last have see she free speak fair act mean time begin a health give he wine to heighten|it choose that yourself no let they laugh that

pray heaven she do not for you know her fierceness I will hail dear mother this I fear it|be carry ill of Caesar at the first Shee pay he home I|will go along with you take the best course to prevent her fury I|will join with you and use my best endeavour dear daughter speak thy grief what free woman how|be this the god I hope will guard our innocence Caesar mercy mercy Caesar
