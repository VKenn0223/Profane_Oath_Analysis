how no success where lie the opposition don Carlos equal with myself profess his free desire and to dispose his daughter to meet thou with all love entertainment what can she argue to thy birth or person attend with so plentiful a fortune I must believe thy courtship dull and faulty when I be at thy year and spring of blood I wound myself like air among the lady command every bosom and can dwell upon their lip like their own breath their eye double their beam on i and she that be of hard composition who no love can soften when I come with charm of language her frost will straight dissolve and from her eye her heart come weep forth to woo i take it yet you that do with a magnetic chain attract so many can possess but one I come not to don Carlos house with cold or lukewarm thought but arm with active fire that will have melt any heart but she bind up with rib of treble ice against i by which I find there be another fate that govern love against who secret doom in vain be eloquence or force so obstinate nothing that I can say in my own cause can make her tongue or look promise a expectation to thrive by any after service this disdain I do resent as it become my honour and now confirm against her pride have think of something that with your consent may tame her scorn or punish it to her repentance name it she have a kinswoman live with she Felisarda daughter to signior Teodore a trade fall merchant brother to don Carlos this Felis. that now live on the charity of her uncle half servant half companion to jacinta and fair I will pretend to love observe i sir and in their presence court she as my mistress methinks I see already how jacinta do fret and frown I like it well to see her cousin so prefer it be the nature fir of woman to be vex when they know any of their servant court another and that love they think not worth their own reward will sting they to the soul when it|be translate where it meet with love and this will either break her stubborn heart or humble she but what if this pretence by such degree convey away your heart that when Jacinta come to sense you can retrieve your passion from the last or say Felisarda shall believe you and give up her heart to your possession when you be by your first desire invite back what cure for Felisarda wound if you affect she not although I like that part of your revenge I will not have my son carry the hate brand of cruelty or hear Fernando break a lady heart but live upon his clear and honest truth and if Jacinta have not value he find his own estimation in some other by fair and noble courtship virtue be above the gaudy shine of gold and if my son love where his honour can suffer the want of dower I can forgive you now read excellent charity and like a father it be the harmony I will hear I chide my fear that do suspect you will prefer wealth in a bride there be no beauty or estate compare to that result from the soul I dare now open this narrow closet and present the name I love above the world it be sir Felisarda equal in her blood within who virtuous poverty more treasure be contain than in those vein of earth which open by our slave do bleed such flood of gold into the lap of Spain pardon my long concealment of her name it|be sin against your virtue and once more speak in that bless language I may hope to call this virgin i how long have you be take with this female holiness before Jacinta be propound this take firm possession of my faith thou have discover thy destruction foolish boy be this your policy to be revenge upon Jacinta who my providence elect to preserve our name and family to dote upon a beggar thou have fling a fire into my brain either resolve to perfect my command and throw off that trifle thou have praise prefer Jacinta to the best seat within thy heart and marry she or live a stranger to i and divest of all those right which nature and thy birth have flatter thou with hope to find expect not alive the stipend of a groom to feed thou nor dead the naked charity of a shroud to hide thou from the worm o sir call back that murder sentence it be sin to let this passion dwell upon you nor will heaven who eye survey our frailty suffer so wild a rage possess you it|be within thy own obedience to divert it when you have hear what I can say more you will chide your fierce command what riddle this Jacinta be already make another and my force upon her vow can be no less than sacrilege this be some new pretence sir not to waste your patience she have give herself by holy contract to Francisco thy young

degenerate baseness shall thy brother who carry all his portion in his blood look high and careful of his honour aim at fortune and with confidence achieve his glorious end and shall his elder brother engage by near tie to advance his name lie beat in the common tract of gull and sacrifice his birth and expectation to a cozen face and poverty instead of add monument that to the world shall be his live chronicle to bury his own and all the antique honour he never sweat for but be cast into his blood within a dunghill thou have forfeit thy birthright which Francisco shall inherit nor shall the loss of my estate be all thy punishment hear and believe with horror if thou renounce not she that have bewitch thy heart Felisarda and by such a choice I shall affect redeem this scandal noble
