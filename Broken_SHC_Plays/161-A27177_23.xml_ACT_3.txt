my tear be laugh at and may my enemy smile to hear i groan and dead may I be pity of none exeunt it|be the governor pleasure in honour of the Dane a custom use to speak a soldier welcome it|be a fit one but be my master here too three day since may I demand without offence so much be|it pride in he however now a slave that I be not admit to his presence his courtesy to you and to mankind may easy resolve you he be free from that poor vice which only empty man esteem a virtue what|be the reason then as you imagine sir why I will tell you you be a woman of a tempt beauty and he however virtuous as a man subject to humane frailty and how far they may prevail upon he shall he see you he be not ignorant and therefore choose with care to|avoid the cause that may produce some strange effect which will not well keep rank with the rare temperance which be admire in his life hitherto this much increase my strong desire to see he it shall rather teach you to thank the prophet that you worship that you be such a man who though he may do any thing which youth and heat of blood invite he to yet dare not give way to they your entertainment|be noble and not like your present fortune and it all those tear which make grief lovely in you in the relation of the sad story that force i to weep too your husband hard fate be not counterfeit you shall rejoice that you have mean to pay a chaste life to his memory and bring to he those sweet which while he live he can not taste of but if you wanton bestow they on another man you offer violence to he though dead and his grieve spirit will suffer for your immodest looseness why I hope sir my willingness to look on he to who I owe my life and service be no proof of any unchaste purpose so I wish too and in the confidence it be not lady I dare the better tell you he will see you this night in which by he I be command to bring you to his chamber to what end I easy shall guess be I Miranda and therefore though I can yield little reason but in a general love to woman goodness why I shall be so tender of your honour I willing will bestow some counsel of you and will you follow it let i first hear it and then I can resolve you my advice then be that you will not as most lady use when they prepare themselves for such encounter study to add by artificial dress to native excellence you without help but see as it be now will make a hermit leave his death head and change his after hope of endless comfort for a few short minute of present pleasure to prevent which lady practice to take away from your perfection and to preserve your chastity unstained the most deform shape that you can put on to cloud your body fair gift or your mind it be labour to so chaste a end will prove the fair ornament to take from the workmanship of heaven be a offence as great as to endeavour to add to it of which I|will not be guilty chastity that lodge in deformity appear rather a mulct impose by nature than a blessing and it|be commendable only when it conquer though never so oft assault in resistance for i I|will therefore so dispose myself that if I hold out it shall be with honour or if I yield Miranda shall find something to make he love his victory Exit with what cunning this woman argue for her own damnation nor shall I hold it for a miracle since they be all bear sophister to maintain that lust be lawful and the end and use of their
