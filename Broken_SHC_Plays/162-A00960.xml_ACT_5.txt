splendour of her beauty you be strike blind as mole that undermine the sumptuous building that allow you shelter you stick like run ulcer on her face and taint the pureness of her native candour and be bad servant cause your master goodness to be dispute of make you the court that be the abstract of all academy to teach and practice noble undertake where courage sit triumphant crown with laurel

until you be again reform and grow new man you never presume to name the court or press into the porter lodge but for a penance to be discipline for your roguery and this do with true contrition yes sir you again may eat scrap and be thankful here|be a cold breakfast after a sharp night walk keep your oath and without grumble vanish we be go sir may all the poorness of my spirit go with you the fetter of my thraldom be file off and I at liberty to right myself and though my hope in Angellina little my honour unto which compare she|be nothing shall like the sun disperse those lower cloud that yet obscure and dim it not the name of brother shall divert i but from he that in the world opinion ruine i I will seek reparation and call he unto a strict account ha it|be near day and if the muse friend rose-cheeked Aurora invite he to this solitary grove as I much hope she will he seldom miss to pay his vow here to she I shall hazard to hinder his devotion the door open it|be he most certain and by|his side my sword bless opportunity I have oversleep myself and lose part of the morn but I|will recover it before I go to bed I write some note within my table-book which I will now consider ha what mean this what do I with a sword learned Mercury need not the aid of Mars and innocence be to itself a guard yet since arm ever protect art I may just wear and use it for since it be make my prize I know not how I|be grow in love with|it and can eat nor study and much less walk without it but I trifle matter of more weight ask my judgement now sir treat of no other theme I|will keep you to it and see you|expound it well Eustace the same sir your young brother who as duty bind he have all this night turn out of door attend to bid good morrow to|you this not in scorn command i to return it will you aught else o much sir here I end not but begin I must speak to you in another strain than yet I ever use and if the language appear in the delivery rough and harsh you be my tutor must condemn yourself from who I learn it when I understand be|it in what style you please what|be your demand I shall endeavour in the self same phrase to make a answer to the point I come not to lay claim to your birthright it|be your own and it|be fit you enjoy it nor ask I from you your learning and deep knowledge though I be not a scholar as you be I know they diamond by your sole industry patience and labour force from steep rock and with much toil attend and but to few that prize their value grant and therefore without rival free wear they these not repine at as you seem to|inform i the motion must be of a strange condition if I refuse to yield to|it therefore Eustace without this tempest in your look propound it and fear not a denial I require then as from a enemy and not a brother the reputation of a man the honour not by a fair war win when I be wake but in my sleep of folly ravish from i with these the restitution of my sword with large acknowledgement of satisfaction my coach my horse I will part with life ere lose one hair of they and what conclude all my mistress Angellina as she be before the musical magic of thy tongue enchant and seduce she these perform and with submission and do public at my father and my uncle intercession that I put in too I perhaps may listen to term of reconcilement but if these in every circumstance be not subscribe to to the last gasp I defy thou these be strict condition to a brother my rest be up nor will I give less I|be not gamester Eustace yet I can guess your resolution stand to win or lose all I rejoice to find you thus tender of your honour and that at length you understand what a wretched thing you be how deep wound by yourself and make almost incurable in your own hope the dead flesh of pale cowardice grow over your fester reputation which no balm or gentle unguent ever can make way to and I be happy that I be the surgeon that do apply those burn corrosive that render you already sensible oh the danger you be plunge in teach you and by a fair gradation how far and with what curious respect and care the peace and credit of a man within which you be think till now shall be prefer before a gawdy outside

the master of dependency that by compound difference between other supply their own necessity with i will never carry it as you be my brother I will dispense a little but no more than honour can give way to nor must I destroy that in myself I love in you and therefore let not hope nor threat persuade you I will descend to any composition for which I may be censure you shall fight then with much unwillingness with you but if there|be no evasion None hear yet a word as for the sword and other frippery in a fair way send for they you shall have they but rather than surrender Angellina or hear it again mention I oppose my breast unto loud thunder cast behind i all tie of nature she detain I|be deaf to all persuasion guard thyself then Eustace I use no other rhetoric clash of sword so near my house brother oppose to brother here be no fence at half-sword hold hold Charles Eustace second he or call in more help come not between we I|will not know nor spare you do|you fight by the book
