tongue and your thought and make your speech answerable to your duty and your conceit fit for my dignity else will I banish you both my person and the world pardon I humble ask but such be my unspotted faith to Endymion that whatsoever seem a needle to prick his finger be a dagger to wound my heart if you be so dear to he how happen it you neither go to see he nor search for remedy for he I have see he to my grief and seek recure with despair for that I can imagine who shall restore he that be the wonder to all man your highness on who hand the compass of the earth be at command though not in possession may show yourself both worthy your sex your nature and your favour if you redeem that honourable Endymion who ripe year foretell rare virtue and who unmellowed conceit promise ripe

till either time end your day or Cynthia her displeasure I be sorry so fair a face shall be subject to so hard a fortune and that the flower of beauty which be honour in court shall here wither in prison Corsites Cynthia may restrain the liberty of my body of my thought she can and therefore do I esteem myself most free though I be in great bondage can you then feed on fancy and subdue the malice of envy by the sweetness of imagination Corsites there be no sweet music to the miserable then despair and therefore the more bitterness I feel the more sweetness I find for so vain be liberty and so unwelcome the follow of high fortune that I choose rather to pine in this castle than to be a prince in any other court a humour contrary to your year and nothing agreeable to your sex the one

praesequar father your sad music be tune on the same key that my hard fortune be have so melt my mind that I wish to hang at your mouth end tell my life end these tune gentleman have I be accustom with these fifty winter have no other house to shroud myself but the broad heaven and so familiar with i have use make misery that I esteem sorrow my chief solace and welcome be that guest to i that can rehearse the sad tale or the bloody tragedy a strange humour may I inquire the cause you must pardon i if I deny to tell it for know that the reveal of grief be as it be a renew of sorrow I have vow therefore to conceal they that I may not only feel the depth of everlasting discontentment but despair of remedy but whence be you what fortune have thrust you to this distress I be go to Thessaly to seek remedy for Endymion my dear friend who have be cast into a dead sleep almost these twenty year wax old and ready for the grave be almost but new come forth of the cradle you need not for recure travel far for who so can clear see the bottom of this fountain shall have remedy for any thing that methinks be unpossible why what virtue can there be in water yes whosoever can shed the tear of a faithful lover shall obtain any thing he will read these word engrave about the brim have you know this by experience or be it place here of purpose to delude man I only will have experience of it and then shall there be a end of my misery and then will I tell the strange discourse that ever yet be hear ah Eumenides what lack you gentleman be you not well yes father but a qualm that often come over my heart do now take hold of i but do never any lover come hither lustre but not lover for often have I see they weep but never can I hear they see the bottom come there woman also some what do they see they all weep that the fountain overflow with tear but so thick become the water with their tear that I can scarce discern the brim much less behold the bottom be faithful lover so scant it seem so for yet hear I never of any ah Eumenides how be thou perplex call to mind the beauty of thy sweet mistress and the depth of thy never die affection how oft have thou honour she not only without spot but suspicion of falsehood and how hardly have she reward thou without cause or colour of despite how secret haste thou be these seven year that have not nor once dare not to name she for discontent she how faithful that have offer to die for she to please she unhappy Eumenides why gentleman do you once love once I father and ever shall be she unkind and you faithful Shee of all woman the most froward and I of all creature the most fond you dote then not love for affection be ground on virtue and virtue be never peevish or on beauty and beauty love to be praise ay but if all virtuous lady shall yield to all that be love or all amiable gentlewoman entertain all that be amorous their virtue will be account vice and their beauty deformity for that love can be but between two and that not proceed of he that be most faithful but most fortunate I will you be so faithful that your tear may make you fortunate yea father if that my tear clear not this fountain then may you swear it be but a mere mockery So say every one yet that weep ah I faint I die ah sweet Semele let i alone and dissolve by weep into water this affection seem strange if he see nothing without doubt this dissemble pass for nothing shall draw i from the belief father I plain see the bottom and there in white marble engrave these word ask one for all and but one thing at all o fortunate Eumenides for so have I hear thou call thyself let i see I can discern any such thing I think thou dream ah father thou be not a faithful lover and therefore can not behold it then ask that I may be satisfy by the event and thyself bless ask so I will and what shall I do but ask and who shall I ask but Semele the possess of who person be a pleasure that can come within the compass of comparison who golden lock seem most curious when they seem most careless who sweet look seem most allure when they be most chaste and who word the more virtuous they be the more amorous they be account I pray thou fortune when I shall first meet with fair Semele dash my delight with some light disgrace least embrace sweetness beyond measure I take a surfeit without recure let she practise her accustom coyness that I may diet my self upon my desire otherwise the fullness of my joy will diminish the sweetness and I shall perish by they before I possess they why do I trifle the time in word the least minute be spend in the get of Semele be more worth than the whole world therefore let i ask what now Eumenides whether be thou draw have thou forget both friendship and duty care of Endymion and the commandment of Cynthia shall he die in a leaden sleep because thou sleep in a golden dream ay let he sleep ever so I slumber but one minute with Semele love know neither friendship nor kindred shall I not hazard the loss of a friend for the obtain of she for who I will often lose myself fond Eumenides shall the entice beauty of a most disdainful lady be of more force than the rare fidelity of a try friend the love of man to woman be a thing common and of course the friendship of man to man infinite and immortal tush Semele do possess my love I but Endymion have deserve it I will help Endymion I find Endymion unspotted in his truth I but I shall find Semele constant in her love I will have Semele what shall I do father thy grey hair be ambassador of experience which shall I ask Eumenides release Endymion for all thing friendship except be subject to fortune love be but a eye worm which only tickle the head with hope and wish friendship the image of eternity in which there be nothing movable nothing mischievous as much difference as there be between beauty and virtue body and shadow colour and life so great odds be there between love and friendship love be a chameleon which draw nothing into the mouth but air and nourish nothing in the body but lung believe i Eumenides desire die in the same moment that beauty sicken and beauty fade in the same instant that it flourish when adversity flow than love ebb but friendship stand stiff in storm time draw wrinkle in a fair face but add fresh colour to a fast friend which neither heat nor cold nor misery nor place nor destiny can alter or diminish o friendship of all thing the most rare and therefore most rare because most excellent who comfort in misery be always sweet and who counsel in prosperity be ever fortunate vain love that only come near to friendship in name will seem to be the same or better in nature father I allow your reason and will therefore conquer my own virtue shall subdue affection wisdom lust friendship beauty mistress be in every place and as common as hare in Atho bee in Hybla fowl in the air but friend to be find be like the phoenix in Arabia but one or the Philadelphi in Arays never above two I will have Endymion sacred fountain in who bowel be hide divine secret I have increase your water with the tear of unspotted thought and therefore let i receive the reward you promise Endymion the true friend to i and faithful lover to Cynthia be in such a dead sleep that nothing can wake or move he do thou see any thing I see in the same pillar these word when she who figure of all be the perfect and never to be measure always one yet never the same still inconstant yet never waver shall come and kiss Endymion in his sleep he shall then rise else never this be strange what see you else there come over my eye either a dark mist or upon the fountain a deep thickness for I can perceive nothing but how be I delude or what difficult nay impossible thing be this methinks it easy good father and how be not a circle of all figure the perfect yes and be not Cynthia of all circle the most absolute yes be it not impossible to measure she who still work by her influence never stand at one stay yes be she not always Cynthia yet seldom in the same bigness always waver in her wax or wane that our body may the better be govern our season the daily give their increase yet never to be remove from her course as long as the heaven continue they yes then who can it be but Cynthia who virtue be all divine must needs bring thing to pass that be miraculous go humble thyself to Cynthia tell she the success of which myself shall be a witness and this assure thyself that she that send to find mean for his safety will now work her cunning how fortunate be I if Cynthia be she that may do it how fond be thou if thou do not believe it I will hasten thither that I may entreat on my knee for succour and embrace in my arm my friend I will go with thou for unto Cynthia must I discover all my sorrow who also must work in i a contentment may I now know the cause that shall be as we walk and I doubt not but the strangeness of my tale will take away the tediousness of our journey let we go I follow
