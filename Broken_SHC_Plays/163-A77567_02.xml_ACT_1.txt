of the god shall make our breast tempestuous or stormy but with the same serenity and quiet as heretofore our heart shall mingle still and fortify their truce let the event expound their riddle if good it be our merit if bad we know our virtue can correct it mean time Philargus take the word of Philocles that though there be no happiness on earth I can esteem above Philargus friendship but fair eudyna love which only be the treasure I can covet from Philargus and can look to live but to enjoy it rather than justle with his friendship I will die to lose it noble Philocles you have make my vow my brother Philocles and friend which be above it I will seek and rather die than fail to gain her love but that and the whole kingdom in addition must divide our friendship or affection as we be twin in birth we|will be in mind unto our late breath let Greece hereafter forget to mention the Tyndaride with their alternate deity and tell of two thessalian brother can refuse a happiness which only be not heaven in detestation of priority will not be happy because they may not share a individual both time and thing love and ambition I have hear man say admit no fellowship it hold not here these will have neither wife nor crown alone they each desire my love but neither can enjoy|it unless he be the other man my love be double take yet must gain neither unless I can enjoy they both together o you god why make you they two person and assign to both but one inseparable mind or why be I mark out to be that one that love and must embrace or two or none oh my perplexity look to the princess
