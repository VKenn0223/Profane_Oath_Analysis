well then I see there be small difference betwixt your state and we you civil Greek you great contriver of free government who skill the world from out all country seek those who you call your king be but the same as be our sovereign tyrant of the east I see they only differ but in name the|effect they show agree or near at least your great man here as our great Satrapa I see lay prostrate be with base shame upon the least suspect or jealousy your king to|conceive or other envy frame only herein they differ that your prince proceed by form of law to|effect his end our persian monarch make his frown convince the strong truth his sword the process end with present death and make no more ado he never stand to give a gloss unto his violence to make it to appear in other hue then that it ought to bear wherein plain deal best his course commend for more he|offend who by the law offend what need have Alexander so to strive by all these show of form to find this man guilty of treason when he do contrive to have he so adjudge do what he can he must not be acquit though he be clear the|offender not the|offence be punish here and what avail the fore-condemned to speak however strong his cause his state be weak ah but it satisfy the world and we think that well do which do by law we see and yet your law serve but your private end and to the compass of your power extend but be it for the majesty of king to sit in judgment thus themselves with you to do man justice be the thing that bring the great majesty on earth to king that by their subalternate minister may be perform as well and with more grate for to command it to be do infer more glory than to do it do embase the|opinion of a power to|invulgar so that sacred presence which shall never go never be see but even as god below like to our persian king in glorious show and who as star affix to their sphere may not descend to be from what they be where king be so like god there subject be not man your king begin this course and what will you be then Indeed since prosperous fortune give the rain to headstrong power and lust I must confess we grecian have lose deep by our gain and this our greatness make we much the less for by the|accession of these mighty state which Alexander wondrous have get he have forget himself and we and rate his state above mankind and we at nought This have thy pompeô feeble Asia wrought thy base adore have transform the king into that shape of pride as he be bring out of his wit out of acknowledge from whence the glory of his greatness spring and that it be our sword that wrought these thing how well be we within the narrow bound of our sufficient yield Macedon before our king enlarge then with our wound and make these sally of ambition before they come to give the regal law to those free state which keep their crown in awe they by these large dominion be make more but we become far weak than before what get we now by win but wide mind and weary body with the|expence of blood what shall ill do since happy fortune find but misery and be not good though good action beget still action and retain our hope beyond our wish draw on Anever end circle of our pain that make we not have do when we have do what can give bound to Alexander end who count the world but small that call he great and his desire beyond his prey distend like beast that murder more than they can eat when shall we look his travail will be do that tend beyond the ocean and the sun what discontentment will there still arise in such a camp of king to intershock each other greatness and what mutiny will put he from his comfort and will mock his hope and never suffer he to have that which he have of all which fortune give and from Philotas blood o worthy man who body now rend on the torture lie will slow that vain of fresh conspiracy as overflow he will do what he can for cruelty do not embitter man but they more wary make than they have be be not your great-man free from torture then must they be likewise rack as other man treason afford a privilege to none who like offend have punishment all one frriend Sostratus come have you ever know such a distract face of court as now such a distrustful eye as man be grow to fear themselves and all and do not know where be the side that shake not who look best in this foul day the|oppressor or the|opress what post what dispatch what advice what search what run what discovery what rumour what suggestion what device to clear the king please people hold the wise retain the rude crush the suspect sort at unaware ere they discern they|be hurt so much the fall of such a weighty peer do shake the state and with he tumble down all who his beam of favour do upbear all who to rest upon his base be know and none that do but touch upon his love be free from fear to perish with his love myself who all the world have know to|embrace Parmenio in the|entireness of my heart and ever in all battle every chase of danger fight still next he on that part be seize on this last night late in my bed and bring unto the presence of the king to pay I think the tribute of my head but o it|be for a more abhor thing I must redeem my danger with the blood of this dear friend this dear parmenio blood his life must pay for i these hand must gore that worthy heart for who they fight before what have the king command such a deed to make the heart of all his subject bleed must that old worthy man Parmenio die o Sostratus he have his doom to die and we must yield unto necessity for come to the king and there receive with unexpected grace he thus begin Polidamas we both have be deceive in hold friendship with that faithless man Parmenio who for all his gloze mine thou see have seek to cut my throat and thou and thou must work revenge for thou and i and therefore haste to Media speedy take these two letter here the one from i unto my sure and trusty servant there the other sign with Philotas seal as if the same to|his father write be carry they both effect what I have say the one will give the|access the other aid I take the letter vow to|effect the same and here I go the instrument of shame but will you charge your honour with this shame I must or be undo with all my name for I have leave all the|adamantive tie of blood and nature that can hold a heart chain to the world my brethren and ally the hostage to caution for my part and for their life must I dishonour i else shall the king rather have turn this sword upon my heart then force it impious have do all fair service to his lord now to be|employ in this foul villainy thus must we do who be enthral to king whether they will just or unlawful thing but now Parmenio o methinks I see thou walk in the|artificial grove of pleasant Susis when I come to thou and thou remember all our ancient love haste to embrace i say o my friend my dear Polidamas welcome my friend well be thou come that we may sit and chat of all the old adventure we have run it|be long Polidamas since we two meet how do my sovereign lord how do my son when I vile wretch while my|answer he attend with this hand give the letter this hand end his speak joy and stabb he to the heart and thus Parmenio thou reward art for all thy service thou that do agree for Alexander to kill Attalus for Alexander I must now kill thou such be the judgment of the heavenly power we other ruin work and other we why this be right now Alexander take the course of power this be a persian trick this be our way here public trial make no doubtful noise but bury clamour quick Indeed now Persia have no cause to rue for you have we undo who undo you this work be do the sad catastrophe of this great act of blood be finish now Philotas end have the tragedy now good my friend I pray thou tell we how as willing to relate as you to hear a full-charged heart be glad to find a ear the council be dismiss from hence and go still Craterus ply the king still in his ear still whisper to he private alone urge it seem a quick dispatch of fear for they who speak but private to king do seldom speak the best and fit thing some will have have he forthwith stone to death accord to the macedonian course but yet that will not satisfy the breath of busy rumour but will argue force there must be some confession make within that must abroad more satisfaction win Craterus with Caenus and Ephestion do main urge to have he torture whereto the king consent and there upon they three be send to see|it accomplish rack iron fire the grisly torturer stand hideous prepare before his face Philotas all unmoved unchanged appear as he will death ugly brow outface and scorn the worst of force and ask they why they stay to torture the king enemy that part be act well God grant we hear no worse a scene then this and all go clear so shall worth act and they who dare to fight against corrupt time shall die upright such heart king may dissolve but not defeat a great man where he fall he shall lie great who ruin like the sacred carcass of scatter temple which still reverent lie and the religious honour they no less than if they stand in all their gallantry but on with thy report straight be hot-iron apply to sear his flesh then wrest rack his comely body strain then iron whip and then the rack afresh then fire again and then the whip again which he endure with so resolve a look as if his mind be of another side then of his body and his sense for sooke the part of nature to be whole tie to honour that he will not once consent so much as with a sight he punishment yet do he like himself yet all be well this argument no tyrant can refel this plea of resolution win his cause more right than all more admiration draw for we love nothing more than to renown man stout miserable high down but now we fear that but o if he aught descend leave here and let the tragedy here end let not the least act now of he at last mar all his act of life and glory past I must tell all and therefore give nigh leave swell with raw tumour ulcer with the jerk of iron whip that flesh from bone have raze and no part free from wound it irk his soul to see the house so foul deface wherein his life have dwell so long time clean and therefore crave he they will now dismiss his grievous torture and he will begin to open all wherein he|have do amiss straight be his torture cease and after they have let he to recover sense he say now Craterus say what you will have i say wherewith as if delude or delay cratetus in wrath call present again to have the torture to be reapply when whatsoever secret of his heart which have be foreconceived but in a thought what friend soever have but take his part in common love he|accuse and so forget himself that now he be more forward to confess than they to urge he thereunto whether affliction have his spirit undo or see to hide or utter be all one both way lay death and therefore he will vie now to be sure to say enough to die and then begin his fortune to deplore humble beseech they who he scorn before that Alexander where he stand behind a Travers out of sight be hear to speak I never think a man that have a mind to|attempt so much have have a heart so weak there he confess that one Hegelochus when first the king proclaim himself jove son incense his father heart against he thus by tell he that now we be undo if we endure that he which do disdain to have be Philip son shall live and reign he that above the state of man will strain his style and will not be that which we be not only we contemn but do disdain the god themselves with who he will compare we have lose Alexander lose say he the king and fall on pride and vanity and we have make a god of our own blood that glorify himself neglect our good intolerable be this impious deed to god who he will match to man he will exceed thus have overnight Hegelochus discourse my father send next day for i to hear the same and there to we all he have say to he make he resay suppose out of wine the night before he may but idly rave when he again far more enrage in heat and passion more urge we to clear the state of such a stain conjure we to redeem the commonweal and do like man or else as man conceal Parmenio think while yet Darius stand this course be out of season and thereby the|extinguish of Alexander blood will now not profit we but the|enemy but he once dead we seize the|other power may make all the orient and all Asia we that course we like to that our council stand thereto we tie our oath and give our hand and as for this he say for Dymnus plot though he be clear yet now it clear he not and yet the force of rack at last can do so much with he as he confess that too And say that fear Bactra will detain the king too long he hasten on his end lest that his father lord of such a train and such a wealth a who the whole depend shall be age by his death prevent these his design and frustrate his intent dum inficiatus eft facinus crudeliter torquerividebatur post confession Philotas ne amicorü quidem misericordiam meruit o will we have not hear this latter jar this all his former strain of worth do mar before this last his foe his spirit commend but now he be unpitied of his friend then be Demetrius likewise bring in place and put to torture who deny the deed Philotas he aver it to his face Demetrius still deny than he espy a youth one calm that be stand by Calin say he how long will thou abide Demetrius vain to avouch a lie the youth that never have be name before in all his torture give they cause to guess Philotas care not now to utter more than have be privy to his practise And see they have as much as they desire they with Demetrius stone he unto death and all who Dymnus name to have conspire with grievous torture now must lose their breath and all that be ally which can not fly be in the hand of justice now to die what must the punishment arrive beyond the offence not with the|offender make a end they all must die who may be fear in time to be the heir unto their kindred crime all other punishment end with our breath but treason be pursue beyond our death the wrath of king do seldom measure keep seek to cure bad part they lance too deep when punishment like lightning shall appear to few man hurt but unto all man fear great elephant and lion murder least the ignoble beast be the most cruel beast but all be well if by the mighty fall of this great man the king be safe free but if this Hydra of ambition shall have other head to spring up in his stead then have he make but way for they to rise who will assault he with fresh treachery the which may teach we to observe this strain to|admire high hill but live within the plain
