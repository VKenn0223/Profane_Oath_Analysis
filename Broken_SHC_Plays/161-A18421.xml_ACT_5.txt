no let of any love to i no more bear he since you to i supply it hate to you which reason and which justice be perform in spirit ten part more than fleshy man to who foresight our act and thought lie open and therefore since he see the treachery late practise by my brother Baligny he will not honour his hand with the justice as he esteem it of his blood revenge to which my sister needs will have he swear before she will consent to marry he o Baligny who will believe there be a man that only since his look be raise upward and have but sacred heaven in sight can bear a mind so more than devilish as for the paint glory of the countenance flit in king do good for nought esteem and the more ill he do the better seem we easy may believe it since we see in this world practice few man

strange thou be love of both the sex yet thou love neither but the good of both in love of woman my affection first take fire out of the frail part of my blood which till I have enjoy be passionate like other lover but fruition past I then love out of judgement the desert of she I love still stick in my heart though the desire and the delight be go which must chance still since the comparison make upon trial betwixt what reason love and what affection make in i the best ever prefer what most love value lest thy love be judgement then and of the mind marry thy worthy mistress now be blind if there be love in marriage so I will but I deny that any man do love affect wife maid widow any woman for neither Fly love milk although they drown in greedy search thereof nor do the bee love honey though the labour of her life be spend in gather it nor those that fat or beast or fowl do any thing therein for any love for as when only nature move man to meat as far as her power rule she do it with a temperate appetite the too much man devour abhor nature and in our most health be our most disease so when humanity rule man and woman it|be for society confine in reason but what excite the bed desire in blood by no mean just can be construe love for when love kindle any know spirit it end in virtue and effect divine and be in friendship chaste and masculine thou shall my mistress be
