subject that though Leonidas our brave general ever come home a fair and great example he never yet return or with less loss or more deserve honour have you not hear the motive to this general good the main one be admiration first in young Agenor for by that name we know the prince of Argos of our Leonidas wisdom and his valour which though a enemy first in he breed wonder that like love succeed that which be follow by a desire to be a friend upon what term soever to such goodness they have a interview and that their friendship may with our peace be ratify it|be conclude Agenor yield up all such strong place as he hold in our territory shall receive with a sufficient dower pay by the queen the fair Merione for his wife but how approve the queen of this since we well know nor be her highness ignorant that her son the prince Theanor make love to this lady and in the noble way which she allow of and I have hear from some familiar with her near secret she so deep prize she be from a infant train up in her service or to speak better rather her own creature she once do say that if the prince shall steal a marriage without her leave or knowledge with this Merione with a little suit she shall grant both their pardon where as now to show herself forsooth a spartan lady and that it|be in her power now it concern the common good not alone to subdue her own affection but command her

doubtful whether it|be more manly to die not seek help or that help be so deadly to pursue it to those reason I have already urge I will add these for but consider sir it be of weight whatever it be that with such vehement action of eye hand foot nay all his body motion Crates incite the prince to then observe with what variety of passion he receive his reason now he|be pale and shake for fear or anger now his natural red come back again and with a please smile he seem to entertain it it|be resolve on be it what it|will to his end may it prosper though the state sink for|it now you be a prince
