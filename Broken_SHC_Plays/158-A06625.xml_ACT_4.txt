Sappho I have hear thy complaint and pity thy agony o Venus my care be only know to thou and by thou only come the cause Cupid why do thou wound i so deep my mother bid i draw my arrow to the head Venus why do thou prove so hateful Cupid take a wrong shaft o Cupid too unkind to make i so kind that almost I transgress the modesty of my kind I be blind and can not see my arrow How come it to pass thou do hit my heart that come by the nature of the head which be king once let out of the bow can find none other light place but the heart be not dismay Phao shall yield if he yield then shall I shame to embrace one so mean if not die because I can embrace one so mean thus do I find no mean well I will work for thou farewell farewell sweet Venus and thou Cupid which be sweet in thy sharpness Cupid what haste thou do put thy arrow in Phao eye and wound thy mother heart you give he a face to allure then why shall not I give he eye to pierce o Venus un happy Venus who in bestow a benefit upon a man haste bring a bane unto a goddess what perplexity do thou feel o fair Phao and therefore make fair to breed in i a frenzy o will that when I give thou golden lock to curl thy head I have shackle thou with iron lock on thy foot and when I nurse thou Sappho with lettuce will it have turn to hemlock have I bring a smooth skin over thy face to make a rough scar in my heart and give thou a fresh colour like the damask rise to make my pale like the stain Turkey o Cupid thy flame with Psyche be but spark and my desire with Adonis but dream in respect of these unacquainted torment laugh Juno Venus be in love but Juno shall not see with who lest she be in love Venus belike be become stale Sappho forsooth because she have many virtue therefore she must have all the favour Venus wax old and then she be a pretty wench when Juno be a young wife now crow foot be on her eye and the black ox have tread on her foot but be Sappho never so virtuous do she think to contend with Venus to be as amorous yield Phao but yield to i Phao I entreat where I may command command thou where thou shall entreat in this case Cupid what be thy counsel Venus must both play the lover and the dissembler and therefore the dissembler because the lover you will ever be play with arrow like child with knife and then when you bleed you cry go to Vulcan entreat by prayer threaten with blow woo with kiss ban with curse try all mean to rid these extremity to what end that he may make i new arrow for nothing can root out the desire of Phao but a new shaft of inconstancy nor any thing turn Sappho but a new arrow of disdain and then they dislike one the other who shall enjoy Phao but Venus I will follow thy counsel for Venus though she be in her latter age for year yet be she in her nonage for affection when Venus cease to love let love cease to rule but come let we to Vulcan what dream be these Mileta and can there be no truth in dream yea dream have their truth methinks I see a stock dove or woodquist I know not how to term it that bring short straw to build his nest in a tall cedar where while with his bill he be frame his building he lose as many feather from his wing as he lay straw in his nest yet scamble to catch hold to harbour in the house he have make he so fall from the bough where he stand and then pitiful cast up his eye he cry in such term as I imagine as may either condemn the nature of such a tree or the dare of such a mind while he lie quake upon the ground and I gaze one the cedar I may perceive ant to breed in the rind covet only to hoard and caterpillar to cleave to the leaf labour only to suck which cause more leaf to fall from the tree then there do feather before from the dove methinks Mileta I sigh in my sleep pity both the fortune of the bird and the misfortune of the tree but in this time quill begin to bud again in the bird which make he look as though he will fly up and then wish I that the body of the tree will bow that he may but creep up the tree then and so hey ho and so what Nothing Mileta but and so I wake but do nobody dream but I I dream last night but I hope dream be contrary that hold my head over a sweet smoke all my hair blaze on a bright flame methinks Ismena cast water to quench it yet the spark fall on my bosom and wipe they away with my hand I be all in a gore blood till one with a few fresh flower staunch it and so stretch myself as stiff I start it be but a dream it be a sign you shall fall in love with hear fair word water signify counsel flower death and nothing can purge your love humour but death you be no interpreter but a interpreter harp always upon love till you be as blind as a harper I remember last night but one I dream my eye tooth be lose and that I thrust it out with my tongue it foretell the loss of a friend and I ever think thou so full of prattle that thou will thrust out the best friend with the tattle yea Mileta but it be loose before and if my friend be lose as good thrust out with plain word as keep in with dissemble dream be but dote which come either by thing we see in the day or meat that we eat and so the common sense prefer it to be the imaginative soft philosophatrix well see in the secret of art and not seduce with the superstition of nature Ismena tongue never lie still I think all her tooth will be loose they be so often jog against her tongue but say on Eugenua there be all what do you dream Canope I seldom dream madam but sithence your sickness I can tell whether with over watch but I have have many fantastical vision for even now slumber by your bed side methinks I be shadow with a cloud where labour to unwrap myself I be more entangle but in the midst of my strive it seem to myself gold with fair drop I fill my lap and run to show it my fellow it turn to dust I blush they laugh and than I wake be glad it be but a dream take heed Canope that gold tempt not your lap and than you blush for shame it be good luck to dream of gold yea if it have continue gold I dream every night and the last night this i though that walk in the sun I be sting with the fly tarantula who venom nothing can expel but the sweet consent of music I try all kind of instrument but find no ease till at the last two lute tune in one key so glut my thirst ear that my grief present seize for joy whereof as I be clap my hand your ladyship call it be a sign that nothing shall assuage your love but marriage for such be the tie of two in wedlock as be the tune of two lute in one key for strike the string of the one straw will stir upon the string of the other and in two mind link in love one can be delight but the other rejoice methinks go by the sea side among pebble I see one play with a round stone ever throw it into the water when the sun shine I ask the name he say it be call Abeston which be once hot will never be cold he give it i and vanish I forget myself delight with the fair show will always show it by candle light pull it out in the sun and see how bright it will look in the fire where catch heat nothing can cool it for anger I throw it against the wall and with the heave up of my arm I wake beware of love Favilla for woman heart be such stone which warm by affection can be cold by wisdom I warrant you for I never credit man word yet be wary for woman be scorch sometime with man eye though they have rather consume than confess cease your talk for I will fain sleep to see if I can dream whether the bird have feather or the aunt wing draw the curtain Come Cupid Vulcan flame must quench Venus fire Vulcan who Venus ho ho Venus Come sweet Vulcan thou know how sweet thou have find Venus who be of all the goddess the most fair have choose thou of all the god the most foul thou must needs then confess I be most love inquire not

with sweet word you be wont to say that the beat of hammer make your head ache and the smoke of the forge your eye water and every coal be a block in your way you weep rose water when you ask and spit vinegar when you have obtain what will you now with new arrow belike Mars have a tough skin one his heart or Cupid a weak arm or Venus a better courage well Venus there be never a smile in your face
