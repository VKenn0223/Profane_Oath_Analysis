wrought with flatter Mentz Mentz with Bohemia trier and Brandenburg for Collen and the palsgrave of the Rhein be principal with saxon in the plot that in a general meet to that purpose the seven select emperor elector most heinous conclude of the murder the reason why they doom he unto death be his deep wisdom and sound policy know while he do live my state be firm he be dead my hope must die with he now Alexander will we be revenge upon this wicked whore of Babylon this hideous monster with the sevenfold head we must with cunning level at the heart with pierce and perish all the body die or strike we off her head by one and one behoove we to use dexterity lest she do trample we under her foot and triumph in our honour overthrow mad and amaze to hear this tragic doom I do subscribe unto your sound advice then hear the rest these seven give but she sentence a near hand put it in execution and but I love Lorenzo as my life I never will betray my dear wife what what the empress

stab he in St. Peter chair though clad in all his pontificalibus why Alexander do thou speak to i as if thou do mistrust my forwardness no thou shall know my love to he be such and in my heart I have proscribe they all that have to do in this conspiracy the band of wedlock shall not serve she turn her fatal lot be cast among the rest and to conclude my soul do live in hell till I have set my foot upon their neck that give this spur of sorrow to my heart but with advice it must be manage not with a headlong rage as thou intend nor in a moment can it be perform this work require long time dissemble look commix with undermine action watch advantage to execute our foe be mighty and their number great it therefore follow that our stratagem must branch forth into manifold deceit endless device bottomless conclusion what by your majesty be prescribe to i that will I execute or die the death I be content to suck my sorrow up and with dull patience will attend the time gape for every opportunity that may present the least occasion although each minute multiply my anguish and to my view present a thousand form of senseless body in my father shape yell with open throat for just
