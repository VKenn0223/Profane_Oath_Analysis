our leg be big than the court standard and therefore out of fashion and such a giggle because one band|be unpin another beard not well turn up and such a fiddle-faddle it|be not to be endure well howsoever you be deal with pray let these stranger find such entertainment as you will have desire have but the chance of war determine it for they as now for we and you brave enemy forget your nation and ungrateful master and know that I can set so high a price on valour though in foe as to reward it with trust and honour sir your twice conquer vassal first by your courage than your clemency here humble vow to sacrifice their life the gift of this your unexampled mercy to your command and service I pray my lord second my suit I have already move the king in private that in our next year expedition they may have some command I shall my lord and glad of the occasion I wonder sir you|will leave the court the sphere where all your grace in full lustre shine i Haly but the reputation of virtuous action pass if not keep up with a access and fresh supply of new one be lose and soon forget and like palace for want of habitation and repair dissolve to heap of ruin but can you leave sir your old indulgent father and forsake the embrace of so fair so chaste a wife and all the beauty of the court beside be mad in love and dote upon your person and be|it not better sleep in their arm then in a cold pavilion in the camp where your short sleep be break and interrupt with noise and alarm Haly thou know not i how I despise these short and empty pleasure and how low they stand in my esteem which every peasant the mean subject in my father empire enjoy as full in as high perfection as he or I and which be have in common by beast aswell as man wherein they equal if not exceed we pleasure to which we|be lead only by sense those creature which have least of reason most enjoy be not the empire you be bear to a scene large enough to exercise your virtue there be virtue civil aswell as military for the one you have give the world a ample proof already now exercise the other it|be no less to govern just make your empire flourish with wholesome law in riches peace and plenty then by the expense of wealth and blood to make new acquisition that I be bear so great I owe to fortune and can pay that debt till virtue set i high in example as I be in title till what the world call fortune gift my action may style their own reward and those too little prince be then themselves when they arise more glorious in man thought then in their eye sir your fame already fill the world and what be infinite can receive degree but will swallow all that be add as our caspian sea receive our river and yet seem not full and if you tempt she more the wind of fortune may come about and take another point and blast your glory no my glory be past danger they|be full blow thing that be blast be but in their bud and as for fortune I nor love nor fear she I be resolve go Haly flatter still your age master still sooth he in his pleasure and still grow great by those art well farewell court where vice not only have usurp the place but the reward and even the name of virtue we|will go and hunt it be a princely sport and much resemble war such war as we where we have use to follow chase it show we pretty danger and acquaint we with situation while I view the hill the thicket and the river here methinks with best advantage I can pitch my camp here range my army there the battle join here make a safe retreat and there enclose the enemy as beast within a toil and yet I can observe the chase stag how he can cast about to seek his safety and when he see his death be unavoidable how he will weep I can observe the dog too how some in swiftness some in scent excel other in cry but let we lose no time methinks the court a prison still still slight and scorn yet this affront have stamp a noble title on my malice and marry it to justice the king be old and when the prince succeed I|be lose past all recovery than I must meet my danger and destroy he first but cunning and close or his son and wife like a fierce tigress will devour i there|be danger every way and since it|be so it|be brave and noble when the fall weight of my own ruin crush those I hate but how to do it that|be the work he stand so high in reputation with the people there|be but one way and that|be to make his father the instrument to give the name and envy to he but to myself the prize and glory he|be old and jealous apt for suspicion against which tyrant ear be never close the prince be young fierce and ambitious I must bring together all these extreme and then remove all medium that each may be the other object my lord now if your plot be right you be befriend with opportunity the king be melancholy apt for any ill impression make a advantage of the prince absence urge some suspect cause of his departure use all your art he|be come sir have you know a action of such glory less swell with ostentation or a mind less taint with felicity it|be a rare temper in the prince be it so rare to see a son so like his father have not I perform action as great and with as great a moderation I sir but that|be forget action on|the last age be like almanac of|the last year it|be well but if with all his conquest what I get in empire I lose in fame I think myself no gainer but be I quite forget sir you know age breed neglect in all and action remote in time like object remote in place be not behold at half their greatness and what be new find better acceptation then what be good or great yet some old man tell story of you in their chimney corner no otherwise they|be all so full of he some magnify his courage some his wit but all admire a greatness so familiar sure Haly thou have forget thyself be thou a courtier or I a king my ear be unacquainted with such bold truth especial from thou sir when I be call to|it I must speak bold and plain but with what eagerness what circumstance unasked thou take such pain to tell i only my son|be the better man sir where subject want the privilege to speak their king may have the privilege to live in ignorance if it|be a secret that concern my life or empire than this boldness may become thou but such unnecessary rudeness savour of some design and this be such a false and squint-eyed praise which seem to look upward on his glory look down upon my fear I know thou hate he and like infect person fain will rub the ulcer of thy malice upon i sir I almost believe you speak your thought but that I want the guilt to make i fear it what mean these guilty blush then sir if I blush it be because you do not to upbraid so try a servant that so often have wake that you may sleep and be expose to danger for your safety and therefore think thou be so wrap so weave into all my trust and counsel that I now must suffer all thy ambition aim at sir if your love grow weary and think you have wear i long enough I|be willing to be leave off but he|be a foolish seaman that when his ship be sink will not unlade his hope into another bottom I understand no allegory and he|be as ill a courtier that when his master|be old desire not to comply with he that must succeed but if he will not be comply with o sir there|be one sure way and I have know it practise in other state what|be that to make the father life the price of the son favour to walk upon the grave of our dead master to our own security it|be this must take do this plainness please you sir thou know my nature too too apt to these suspicion but I hope the question be never move to thou in other kingdom sir but have my son no such design Alas you know I hate he and shall I tell you he have you|will say it be but malice no more of that good Haly I know thou love i but least the care of future safety tempt thou to forfeit present loyalty or present loyalty forfeit thy future safety I|will be your reconciler call he hither o sir I wish he be within my call or you why where be he he have leave the court sir I like not these excursion why so sudden it|be but a sally of youth yet some say he|be discontent that grate my heartstring what shall discontent he except he think I live too long heaven forbid and yet I know no cause of his departure I|be sure he|be honour and love by all the soldier god the people idol i Haly the persian still worship the rise sun but who go with he none but the captain the captain I like not that never fear it sir it|be true they love he but as their general not their prince and though he be most forward and ambitious it|be temper with so much humility and so much the more dangerous there be some that use humility to serve their pride and seem humble upon their way to be the proud at their wish journey end sir I know not what way or end you mean it|be true in popular state or where the prince title be weak and must be prop by the people power there by familiar way it|be necessary to win on man affection but none of these can be his end but there|be another end for if his glory rise upon the ruin of i why not his greatness too true sir ambition be like love impatient both of delay and rival but nature but empire I have almost forget sir he have a suit to your majesty what be|it to give the turkish prisoner some command in the next action nay then it|be too apparent he fear my subject loyalty and now must call in stranger come deal plain I know thou can discover more I can discover sir the depth of your great judgement in such danger what shall I do Haly your wisdom be so great it be presumption for i to advise well we|will consider more of that but for the present let he with speed be send for Mahomet I thank thou I have one faithful servant honest Haly how do he take it swallow it as greedy as parch earth drink rain now the first part of our design be over his ruin but the second our security must now be think on my lord you be too sudden though his fury determine rash yet his cold fear before it execute consult with reason and that not satisfy with show or shadow will ask to be convince by something real now must we frame some plot and then discover it or intercept some letter which ourselves have forge before and still admire the miracle and thank the providence then we must draw in somebody to be the public agent that may stand betwixt we and danger and the people envy who fit than the grand caliph and he shall set a grave religious face upon the business but if we can work he for he|be so full of foolish scruple or if he shall prove false and then betray we betray we sure my lord your fear have blind your understanding for what serve the king will not his threat work more than our persuasion while we look on and laugh and seem as ignorant as unconcern and thus appear friend to either side on both may work our end my lord the turkish pasha desire access admit they I know their business they long to hear with what success you move the king in their behalf but now they|be come I|will make they do my business better than I do they leave we a while my lord my duty and affection to the prince and the respect I owe to man of honour extort a secret from i which yet I grieve to utter the prince depart leave to i the care of your affair which I as he command have recommend to the king but with so unlooked for a success my lord fear not to speak our doom while we fear not to hear it we be lose before and can be ready now to meet that fate we then expect though he that bring unwelcome news have but a lose office yet he that show your danger first and then your way to safety may heal that wound he make you know the king with jealous eye have ever look awry on his son action but the fame and glory of the last war have raise another spirit envy and jealousy be twine together yet both lie hide in his dissemble smile like two conceal serpent till I unhappy I move this question tread upon they both and rouse their sleep anger then cast from he his doubt and straight confirm in all his fear decree to you a speedy death to his own son a close restraint but what will follow I dare not think you by a sudden flight may find your safety sir death and we be not such stranger that we shall make dishonour or ingratitude the price of life it be the prince gift and we but wear it for his sake and service then for his sake and service pray follow my advice though you have lose the favour of your unworthy master yet in the province you late govern you have those dependence and interest that you may raise a power to serve the prince I|will give he timely notice to stand upon his guard my lord we thank you but we must give the prince intelligence both when and how to employ we if you will write commit it to my care and secrecy to see it safe convey we shall my lord these man be once the prince foe and then unwilling they make he great but now be his friend shall willing undo he and which be more be still his friend what little art govern the world we need not a arm enemy or corrupt friend when service but misplace or love mistake perform the work nor be this all the use I|will make of they when once they be in arm their master shall be wrought to think these force raise against he and this shall so endear i to he that though dull virtue and the god overcome my subtle mischief I may find a safe retreat and may at least be sure if not more mighty to be more secure
