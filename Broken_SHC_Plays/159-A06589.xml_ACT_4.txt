not stir one whit then use all thy force though he feel it and wake what stone still turn I think to earth with lie so long on the earth do not thou Corsites before Cynthia pull up a tree that forty year be fasten with root and wreathe in knot to the ground do not thou with main force pull open the iron gate which no ram or engine can move have my weak thought make brawn-fallen my strong arm or be it the nature of love or the quintessence of the mind to breed numbness or litherness or I know not what languish in my joint and sinew be but the base string of my body or do the remembrance of Tellus so refine my spirit into a matter so subtle and divine that the other fleshy part can work while they muse rest thyself rest thyself nay rent thyself in piece Corsites and strive in spite of love fortune and nature to lift up this dull body heavy than dead and more senseless than death but what be these so fair fiend that cause my hair to stand upright and spirit to fall down hag out alas nymph I crave pardon ay i out what do I here you see Pythagoras what ridiculous opinion you hold and I doubt not but you be now of another mind madam I plain perceive that the perfection of your brightness have pierce through the thickness that cover my mind in so much that I be no less glad to be reform then ashamed to remember my grossness they be thrice fortunate that live in your palace where truth be not in colour but life virtue not in imagination but execution I have always study to have rather live virtue then paint god the body of truth than the tomb but let we walk to Endymion it may be it lie in your art to deliver he as for Eumenides I fear he be dead I have allege all the natural reason I can for such a long sleep I can do nothing till I see he coin Floscula I be sure you be glad that you shall behold Endymion I be bless if I may have he recover be you in love with his person no but with his virtue what say you Semele madam I dare say nothing for fear I offend belike you can speak except you be spiteful but as good be silent as saucy Panelion what punishment be fit for Semele in who speech and thought be only contempt and sourness I love not madam to give any judgement yet sith your highness command I think to commit her tongue close prisoner to her mouth agree Semele if thou speak this twelvemonth thou shall forfeit thy tongue behold Endymion alas poor gentleman have thou spend thy youth in sleep that once vow all to my service hollow eye grey hair wrinkle cheek and decay limb be it destiny or deceit that have bring this to pass if the first who can prevent thy wretched star if the latter I will I may know thy cruel enemy I favour thou Endymion for thy honour thy virtue thy affection but to bring thy thought within the compass of thy fortune I have seem strange that I may have thou stay and now be thy day end before my favour begin but who have we here be it not Corsites it be but more like a leopard than a man awake he how now Corsites what make you here How come you deform look on thy hand and than thou see the picture of thy face miserable wretch and accurse how be I delude madam I ask pardon for my offence and you see my fortune deserve pity speak on thy offence can deserve great punishment but see thou rehearse the truth else shall thou not find i as thou wish i madam as it be no offence to be in love be a man mortal so I hope can it be no shame to tell with who my lady be heavenly your majesty commit to my charge fair tellus who beauty in the same moment take my heart captive that I undertake to carry her body prisoner since that time have I find such combat in my thought between love and duty reverence and affection that I can neither endure the conflict nor hope for the conquest in love a thing far unfit the name of a captain and as I think the tough and unsmoothed nature of Corsites but forth feel this continual war I think rather by parley to yield then by certain danger to perish I unfold to Tellus the depth of my affection and frame my tongue to utter a sweet tale of love that be wont to sound nothing but threat of war Shee too fair to be true and too false for one so fair after a nice denial practise a notable deceit command i to remove Endymion from this Caban and carry he to some dark cave which I seek to accomplish find impossible and so by fairy or fiend have be thus handle how say you my lord be not Tellus always practise of some deceit in sooth Corsites thy face be now too foul for a lover and thy heart too fond for a soldier you may see when warrior become wantoness how their manner alter with their face be it not a shame Corsites that have live so long in mar his camp thou shall now be rock in Venus cradle do thou we be Cupid quiver at thy girdle and make lance of look well Corsites rouse thyself and be as thou have be and let Tellus who be make all of love melt herself in her own looseness madam I doubt not but to recover my former state for tellus beauty never wrought such love in my mind as now her deceit have despite and yet to be revenge of a woman be a thing than love itself more womanish these spot gentleman be to be wear out if you rub they over with this lunary so that in place where you receive this main you shall find a medicine I thank you for that the god bless i from love and these pretty lady that haunt this green Corsites I will Tellus see your amiable face how spiteful Semele laugh that dare not speak can you not stir Endymion with that double strength of you not so much as his finger with all my force Pythagoras and gyptes what think you of Endymion what reason be to be give what remedy madam it be impossible to yield reason for thing that happen not in compass of nature it be most certain that some strange enchantment have bind all his sense what say you gyptes with Pythagoras that it be enchantment and that so strange that no art can undo it for that heaviness argue a malice unremovable in the enchantress and that no power can end it till she die that do it or the heaven show some mean more than miraculous o Endymion can spite itself devise a mischief so monstrous as to make thou dead with life and live be altogether dead where other number their year their hour their minute and step to age by stair thou only haste thy year and time in a cluster be old before thou remember thou be young no more floscula pity do he no good I will any thing else may and I vow by the unspotted honour of a lady he shall not miss it but be this all Gyptes that be to be do all as yet it may be that either the enchantress shall die or else be discover if either happen I will then practise the utmost of my art in the mean season about this grove will I have a watch and the first live thing that touch Endymion to be take Corsites what say you will you undertake this good madam pardon i I be overtake too late I shall rather break into the midst of a main battle then again fall into the hand of those fair baby well I will provide other Pithagoras and Gyptes you shall yet remain in my court till I hear what may be do in this matter we attend let we go in
