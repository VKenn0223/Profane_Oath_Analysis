fundamental ground of law in general for the most solid but this particular law that i concern now at the present if that be firm and strong and powerful and forcible and permanent I be a young man that have a old father nothing more strong sir it be secundum statutum principis confirmatum cum voce senatum et voce republicae nay consummatum et exemplificatum be it not in force when diverse have already taste it and pay their life for penalty it|be true my father must be next this day complete full fourscore year upon he he|be here then sub poena statuti hence I can tell he true then all the

in their hope reversion and die upon the thought and by your leave sir have you not place fill up in the law by some grave senator that you imagine have hold they long enough and such spirit as you be they remove will leap into their dignity dic quibus in terris & eris mihi magnus Apollo but tell i faith you fair opinion be|it not a sound and necessary law this by the duke enact never do Greece our ancient seat of brave philosopher among all her Nomotheta and lawgiver not when she flourish in her seven fold sage who live memory can never die produce a law more grave and necessary I|be of that mind to I will maintain sir Draco Oligarchy that the government of community reduce into few frame a fair state Solon Crecopedi that cut off poor man debt to their rich creditor be good and charitable but not full allow his Sisaithie do reform that error his honourable senate of Areopagita Lycurgus be more loose and give too free and licentious reins unto his discipline as that a young woman in her husband weakness may choose her able friend to propagate that so the commonwealth may be supply with hope of lusty spirit Plato do err and so do Aristotle allow lewd and luxurious limit to their law but now our Epire our Epire Evander our noble and wise prince have hit the law that all our predecessive student have miss unto their shame enter Cleanthes forbear the praise sir it|be in itself most

it be no rule in justice there to punish o sir you understand a conscience but not law why sir be there so main a difference you|will never be good laywer if you understand not that I think then it|be the best to be a bad one why sir the very letter and the sense both do both overthrow you in this statute which that speak that every man live to fourscore year and woman to threescore shall then be cut off as fruitless to the republic and law shall finish what nature linger at and this suit shall soon be dispatch in law it be so plain it can have no demur the church-book overthrow it and so it do the church book overthrow it if you read it well still you run from the law into error you say it take the life of innocent I say no and so say common reason what man live to fourscore and woman to three that can die innocent a fine lawful evasion good sir rehearse the full statute to me● fie that|be too tedious you have already the full sum in the brief relation sir among many word may be find
