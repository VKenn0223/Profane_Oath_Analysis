I have bring my son Diogenes to be teach of thou what can thy son do you shall see their quality dance sirrah how like you this do he well the better the worse the music very good the musician very bid who only study to have their string in tune never frame their manner to order now shall you see the other tumble sirrah how like you this why do you laugh to see a wag that be bear to break his neck by destiny to practise it by art this dog will bite i I will not be with he fear not boy dog eat no thistle I marvel what dog thou be if thou be a dog when I be hungry a mastiff and when my belly be full a spaniel do thou believe that there be any god that thou be so dogged I must needs believe there be god for I think thou a enemy to they why so because thou have teach one of thy son to rule his leg and not to follow learning the other to bend his body every way and his mind no way thou do nothing but snarl and bark like a dog it be the next way to drive away a thief now shall you hear the three who sign like a nightingale I care not for I have hear a nightingale sing herself sing sirrah Loe Diogenes I be sure thou can not do so much but there be never a thrush but can what have thou teach mane thy man to be as unlike as may be thy son he have teach i to fast lie hard and run away how say thou Perim will thou be with he ay so he will teach i first to run away thou need not be teach thy leg be so nimble how say thou Milo will thou be with he nay hold your peace he shall not why there be not room enough for he and i both to tumble in one tub well Diogenes I perceive my son brook not thy manner I think no less when they know my virtue farewell Diogenes thou need not have scrape root if thou will have follow Alexander nor thou have follow Alexander if thou have scrape root I fear i Apelles that thy eye have blab that which thy tongue dare not what little regard have thou while Alexander view the counterfeit of Campaspe thou stand gaze on her countenance if he espy or but suspect thou must needs twice perish with his hate and thy own love thy pale look when he blush thy sad countenance when he smile thy sigh when he question may breed in he a jealousy perchance a frenzy o love I never before know what thou be and now haste thou make i that I know not what myself be only this I know that I must endure intolerable passion for unknown pleasure dispute not the cause wretch but yield to it for better it be to melt with desire then wrestle with love cast thyself on thy careful bed be content to live unknown and die unfound o Campaspe I have paint thou in my heart paint nay contrary to my art imprint and that in such deep character that nothing can raze it out unless it rub thy heart out it shall go hard but this peace shall bring we some pleasure down with arm and up with leg this be a world for the nonce sweet youth if you know what it be to save your sweet blood you will not so foolish go about to spend it what delight can there be in gash to make foul scar in fair face and crooked maim in straight leg as though man be bear goodly by nature will of purpose become deform by folly and all forsooth for a new find term call valiant a word which breed more quarrel than the sense can commendation it be true lay a featherbed have no fellow good drink make good blood and shall pelt word spill it I mean to enjoy the world and to draw out my life at the wiredrawer not to curtail it off at the cutler you may talk of war speak big conquer world with great word but stay at home where in steed of alarm you shall have dance for hot battle with fierce man gentle skirmish with fair woman these pewter coat can never sit so well as satin doublet believe i you can conceive the pleasure of peace unless you despise the rudeness of war it be so but see Diogenes pry over his tub Diogenes what say thou to such a morsel I say I will spit it out of my mouth because it shall not poison my stomach thou speak as thou be it be no meat for dog I be a dog and philosophy rate i from carrion uncivil wretch who manner be answerable to thy calling the time be thou will have have my company have it not be as thou say too dear I remember there be a thing that I repent i of and now thou haste tell it indeed it be too dear of nothing and thou dear to nobody down villain or I will have thy head break will you couch avaunt cur come sweet lay let we go to some place and possess peace but first let we sing there be more pleasure in tune of a voice then in a volley of shot now let we make haste lest Alexander find we here methinks Hephestion you be more melancholy than you be accustom but I perceive it be all for Alexander you can neither brook this peace nor my pleasure be of good cheer though I wink I sleep not melancholy I be not nor well content for I know not how there be such a rust creep into my bone with this long ease that I fear I shall not scour it out with infinite labour yes yes if all the travail of conquer the world will set either thy body or i in tune we will undertake they but what think you of Apelles do you ever see any so perplex he neither answer direct to any question nor look steadfast upon any thing I hold my life the painter be in love it may be for common we see it incident in artificer to be enamour of their own work as Archidamus of his wooden dove Pygmalion of his ivory image Arachne of his wooden swan especial painter who play with their own conceit now covet to draw a glance eye than a roll now a wink still mend it never end it till they be catch with it and then poor soul they kiss the colour with their lip with which before they be loath to taint their finger I will find it out page go speedy for Apelles will he to come hither and when you see we earnest in talk sudden cry out Apelles shop be on fire it shall be do forget not your lesson I marvel what your device shall|be the event shall prove I pity the poor painter if he be in love pity he not I pray thou that severe gravity set aside what do you think of love as the macedonian do of their herb beet which look yellow in the ground and black in the hand think it better see than touch but what do you imagine it to be a word by superstition think a God by use turn to a humour by self will make a flatter madness you be too hard heart to think so of love let we go to Diogenes Diogenes thou may think it somewhat that Alexander come to thou again so soon if you come to learn you can not come soon enough if to laugh you be come too soon it will better become thou to be more courteous and frame thyself to please and you better to is less if you dare displease what do thou think of the time we have here that we have light be and lose much if one be sick what will thou have he do be sure that he make not his physician his heir if thou may have thy will how much ground will content thou as much as you in the end must be content withal what a world no the length of my body Hephestion shall I be a little pleasant with he you may but he will be very perverse with you it skill not I can be angry with he Diogenes I pray thou what do thou think of love a little worse than I can of hate and why because it be better to hate the thing which make to love than to love the thing which give occasion of hate why be not woman the best creature in the world next man and bee what do thou dislike chief in a woman one thing what that she be a woman in my opinion thou be never bear of a woman that thou think so hardly of woman but not come Apelles who I be sure be as far from thy thought as thou be from his cunning Diogenes I will have thy cabin remove near to my court because I will be a philosopher and when you have do so I pray you remove your court further from my cabin because I will not be a courtier but here come Apelles Apelles what piece of work have you now in hand none in hand if it like your majesty but I be devise a platform in my head I think your hand put it in your head be it nothing about Venus no

their last work be say to excel themselves and in this I have so much please myself that the shadow as much delight i be a artificer as the substance do other that be amorous you lay your colour gross though I can not paint in your shop I can spy into your excuse be not ashamed Apelles it be a gentleman sport to be in love call hither Campaspe methinks I may have be make privy to your affection

he live to do as Alexander will Campaspe here be news Apel be in love with you it please your majesty to say so Hephestion I will try she to Campaspe for the good quality I know in Apelles and the virtue I see in you I be determine you shall enjoy one the other how say you Campaspe will you say I your handmaid must obey if you command think you not Hephestion that she will fain be command I be no thought catcher but I guess unhappy I will not enforce marriage where I can compel love but your majesty may move a question where you be willing to have a match Hephestion these party be agree they will have i both priest and witness Apelles take Campaspe why move you not Campaspe take Apelles will it not be if you be ashamed one of the other by my consent you shall never come together but dissemble not Campaspe do you love Apelles pardon my lord I love Apelles Apelles it be a shame for you be love so open of so fair a virgin to say the contrary do you love Campaspe only Campaspe two love worm Hephestion I perceive Alexander can subdue the affection of man though he conquer their country love fall like dew aswell upon the low grass as upon the high cedar spark have their heat ant their gall fly their spleen well enjoy one another I give she thou frank Apelles thou shall see that Alexander make but a toy of love and lead affection in setter use fancy as a fool to make he sport or as a minstrel to make he merry it be not the amorous glance of a eye can settle a idle thought in the heart no no it be child game a life for seamster and scholar the one prick in clout have nothing else to think on the other pick fancy out of book have little else to marvel at go Apelles take with you your Campaspe Alexander be cloy with look on that which thou wonder at thank to your majesty on bend knee you have honour Apelles thank with bow heart you have bless Campaspe page go warn Clitus and Parmenio and the other lord to be in a readiness let the trumpet sound strike up the drum and I will present into Persia how now Hephestion be Alexander able to resist love as he lift the conquer of Thebes be not so honourable as the subdue of these thought it be a shame Alexander shall desire to command the world if he can not command himself but come let we go I will try whether I can better bear my hand with my heart than I can with my eye and good Hephestion when all the world be win and every country be thou and i either find i out another to subdue or of my word I will fall in love
