stay cruel Nisa thou know not from who thou fly and therefore fly I come not to offer violence but that which be inviolable my thought be as holy as thy vow and I as constant in love as thou in cruelty lust follow not my love as shadow do body but truth be weave into my love as vein into body let i touch this tender arm and say my love be endless and to no end it be without spot and shall be without hope do thou disdain love and his law I do not disdain that which I think be not yet laugh at those that honour it if it be time shall bring to pass that Nisa shall confess there be love then also will love make i confess that Nisa be a fool be it folly to love which the god account honourable and man esteem holy the god make any thing lawful because they be god and man honour shadow for substance because they be man both god and man agree that love be a consume of the heart and restore a bitter death in a sweet life god do know and man shall that love be a consume of wit and restore of folly a stare blindness and a blind gaze will thou allot i death no but discretion yield some hope hope to despair not so long as Nisa be a woman therein Ramis you show yourself a man why in flatter yourself that all woman will yield all may thou shall swear that we can I will follow thou and practise by denial to be patient or by disdain die and so be happy though thou have overtake i in love yet have I overtake thou in run fair Celia yield to love to sweet love Montanus thou be mad that have no breath almost in run so fast thou will yet spend more in speak so foolish yield to love can or if I do to thy love I will not the fair wolf choose the foul if he be faithful and he that endure most grief nor he that have most beauty if my thought be wolvish thy hope may be as thy comparison be beastly I will thy word be as thy look be lovely I will thy look be as thy affection be blind fair face shall have smooth heart fresh flower have crooked root woman beauty will wane and then no art can make they fair man folly will ever wax and then what reason can make they wise to be amiable and not to love be like a paint lady to have colour and no life to be amorous and not lovely be like a pleasant fool full of word and no desert what call you desert what lovely no lovely thing than wit no great desert than patience have not I a excellent wit if thou think so thy self thou be a excellent fool fool no Celia thou shall find i as wise as I do thou proud and as little to digest thy taunt as thou to brook my love I think Montanus that you can not deserve when I tell you what it be patience sweet Celia I will be patient and forget this then want you wit that you can be content to be patient a hard choice if I take all well to be a fool if find fault than to want patience the fortune of love and the virtue be neither to have success nor mean farewell farewell nay I will follow and I know not how it come to pass disdain increase desire and the far possibility stand the near approach hope Polypus Niobe be ever of the colour of the stone it slick to and thou ever of his humour thou talk with find you fault that I love so many will you have i like none yes one who shall make choice but myself myself for another to put thought into my head be to pull the brain out of my head take not measure of my affection but weigh your own the oak find no fault with the dew because it also fall on the bramble believe i Silvestris the only way to be mad be to be constant poet make their wreathe of laurel lady of sundry flower sweet Niobe a river run into diverse brook become shallow and a mind divide into sundry affection in the end will have none what joy can I take in the fortune of my love when I shall know many to have the like favour turtle flock by couple and breed both joy and young one but bee in swarm and bring forth wax and honey why do you covet many that may find sweetness in one why have Argus a hundred eye and may have see with one because while he sleep with some he may wake with other some and I love many because be deceive by the inconstancy of diverse I may yet have one that be but a device of Juno that know Jupiter love and this a rule of Venus that know man lightness the whole heaven have but one sun but star infinite the rainbow be ever in one compass but of sundry colour a woman have but one heart but a thousand thought my lute though it have many string make a sweet consent and a lady heart though it harbour many fancy shall embrace but one love the string of my heart be tune in a contrary key to your lute and make as sweet harmony in discord as you in concord why what string be in lady heart not the base there be no base string in a woman heart the mean there be never mean in woman heart the treble yea the treble double and treble and so be all my heart string farewell sweet Niobe let we sing that I may die with the swan it will make you sigh the more and live with the Salamich be thy tune fire be you death no but when I have hear thy voice I be content to die I will sing to content thou inconstant Niobe unhappy Silvestris yet have I rather she shall rather love all then none for now though I have no certainty yet do I find a kind of sweetness cruel Nisa bear to slaughter man coy Celia breed up in skoftes waver yet witty Niobe but be we all meet yea and meet withal if your fortune be answerable to i for I find my mistress immovable and the hope I have be to despair Mine in pride intolerable who bid i look for no other comfort then contempt i be best of all and worst this be my hope that either she will have many or none I fear our fortune can thrive for Erisychthon have fell down the holy tree of Ceres which will increase in her choler and in her nymph cruelty let we see whether our garland be there which we hang on that tree and let we hang ourselves upon another a remedy for love irremovable but I will first see whether all those that love Niobe do like in the mean season I will content myself with my share here be the tree o mischief scarce to be believe in possible to be pardon pardon it be not for Erisychthon perish with famine and be able to starve those that look on he here hang our garland something be write read i cedit amor rebus res age tutus eris and i sit mihi si fancy sit bene nota mihi now for myself victoriatecum stabit scilicet you see their posy be as their heart and their heart as their speech cruel proud and waver let we all to the temple of Cupid and entreat his favour if not to obtain their love yet to revenge their hate Cupid be a kind god who know our unsported thought will punish they or release we we will study what revenge to have that our pain proceed of our own mind than plague may also proceed from they be you all agree I consent but what if Cupid deny help then he be no god but if he yield what shall we ask revenge then let we prepare ourselves for Cupid sacrifice Come Protea dear daughter that name must thou
