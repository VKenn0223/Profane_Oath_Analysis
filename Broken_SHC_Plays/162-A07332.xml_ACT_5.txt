Caesar but your mother escape escape how can it be but you be false and all conspire together to betray Xiphilin my life in save she how can she escape we choose the night to act it in but night prove not so black as night the star give light no wind at all blue as we launch forth Xiphilin down in the galley Agrippina lie and at her foot lie Aceronia with joy discourse of your courtesy and favour late show she but when I the watchword give the cover of the place load with lead fall down and press to death her servant Gallus but when the other part by fortune strong break not nor the vessel be lose asunder all be in amaze the rower straightway think it best to weigh the galley at one side and sink she so there Aceronia float in the wave feign herself to be the empress cry help help the prince his mother but the rower with pole and oar straight kill she as she swim but Agrippina in a silence cause by policy or fear swim to the bank have receive but one wound and there succour by little bark through Lucrine lake to her own house be carry at the last o I be lose and dead I shall be straight surprise and kill she|will arm her slave and stir the soldier up or to the senate house

Agrippina live call Burrhus to i send forth the soldier to dispatch she straight it be no action for a soldier hand nor will the camp for brave Germanicus her father sake be draw to butcher she let Anicetus finish the exploit he have begin it must be so go on with thy religious act good Anicetus thou be oblige to finish it or else what thou have do already will procure my ruin rather than security choose thou what aid thou will I have they ready fear it not Caesar Agrippina dead o comfortable voice thou be the man thou only Anicetus that bestow the empire upon Nero to thy gift I will acknowledge it and celebrate this as my day of coronation what plot shall we invent to hide the deed and put the intent of murder upon she to bring you news of her escape I|will find a way to do|it it|be strange none yet come from she see Agerinus come enter Agerinus all health to Caesar Augusta by the favour of the god have late escape a strange and wonderful danger at sea Caesar when any of her servant come what mean this poniard Anicetus let fall a poniard behind Agerinus in Caesar presence Agerinus treason Ziphilin Shee send to murder i drag hence the slave and torture he to death I be as free from guilt in this as innocence itself hence with the villain to his death and thou dear Anicetus forward with thy plot exeunt leave i alone but be not far from i exeunt who will rely upon the gratitude of man or trust the fruit of benefit that now behold or shall hereafter read my woeful fortune ay that have bestow whatever the world contain to be possess by impious Nero in reward expect nothing but bloody death it|be too too true that strange deceitful galley be a plot a impious engine make to murder i as by the fierceness of the slave my wound and Aceronia death it do appear can I expect that Nero shall relent or that the tyrant in a brother blood imbrue already shall not rather think no mischief can be safe till full do o have his thought be good have my escape be grateful to he all the house ere this with visitant and client have be fill to ask and see how Caesar mother do where now be all the hail the bend knee low prostrate face and officious tongue that strive in

fly what region be there in the other world but my injustice have already fill with wrong ghost there young Silanus wander Lollia Paulina and great Claudius my murder lord yet those sad spirit perchance abhor Nero base ingratitude and glut with revenge will cease to hate at last and pity Agrippina state ay i be Anicetus come again then I be dead past hope murder help help Xiphilin you guess our business right but it|be in vain to call for help your guard be far enough o hold your hand a while hear i but speak consider with yourselves before you act a deed so execrable as will stick a last brand on your abhor name this murder will be famous through the world all man will fly your hate company like bird of night shall you for ever hide your guilty head or which be worse than that Nero himself who do command the deed as you pretend shall guerdon you with death and quit himself by punish of you o rather venture Nero frown and keep your innocence can they be innocent that disobey their prince his will but sure you do mistake the prince I be his mother it|be I that give he birth nay more that put into his hand the sceptre of the world can he command my death we do not stand examine the cause then strike this womb this tragical and ever curse womb that to the ruin of mankind bring forth Xiphilin that monster Nero here here take revenge here justice bid you strike let these sad wound serve to appease the hatred of the earth against Agrippina for dire Nero birth thank noble Burrhus to visit Agrippina I like not that I|will spare my visit then Otho will lose his wife then you can tell what she may be in time how do he look upon the business prithee let|we find he out exeunt what doleful noise be this ay i I fear Britannicus Pallas farewell enter Nero I do not
