Parmenio I can tell whether I shall more commend in Alexander victory courage or courtesy in the one be a resolution without fear in the other a liberality above custom Thebes be raise the people not rack tower throw down body not thrust aside a conquest without conflict and a cruel war in a mild peace Clytus it become the son of Philip to be none other than Alexander be therefore see in the father a full perfection who can have doubt in the son a excellency for as the moon can borrow nothing else of the sun but light so of a fire in who nothing but virtue be what can the child receive but singular it be for Turk to stain each other not for Dyamorde in the one to be make a difference in goodness in the other no comparison you mistake i Parmenio if while I commend Alexander you imagine I call Philip into question unless happy you conjecture which none of judgement will conceive that because I like the fruit therefore I heave at the tree or covet to kiss the child I therefore go about to poison the teat ay but Clytus I perceive you be bear in the east and never laugh but at the sun rise which argue though a duty where you ought yet no great devotion where you may we will make no controversy of that which there ought to be no question only this shall be the opinion of we both that none be worthy to be the father of Alexander but Philip nor any meet to be the son of Philip but Alexander soft Clytus behold the spoil and prisoner a pleasant sight to we because profit be join with honour not much painful to they because their captivity be ease by mercy fortune thou do never yet deceive virtue because virtue never yet do trust fortune sword and fire will never get spoil where wisdom and fortitude bear sway o Thebes thy wall be raise by the sweetness of the harp but raze by the shrillness of the trumpet Alexander have never come so near the wall have Epaminondas walk about the wall and yet may the theban have be merry in their street if he have be to watch their tower but destiny be seldom foresee never prevent we be here now captive who neck be yoke by force but who heart can not yield by death Come Campaspe and the rest let we not be ashamed to cast our eye on he on who we fear not to cast our dart madam you need not doubt it be Alexander that be the conqueror Alexander have overcome not conquer to bring all under his subjection be to conquer he can subdue that which be divine Thebes be not virtue be Alexander as he tender virtue so he will you he drink not blood but thirst after honour he be greedy of victory but never satisfy with mercy in fight terrible as become a captain in conquest mild as beseem a king in all thing then which nothing can be great he be Alexander then if it be such a thing to be Alexander I hope it shall|be not miserable thing to be a virgin for if he save our honour it be more than to restore our good and rather do I wish he preserve our fame then our life which if he do we will confess there can be no great thing than to be Alexander Clytus be these prisoner of whence these spoil like your majesty they be prisoner and of Thebes of what calling or reputation I know not but they seem to be lady of honour I will know madam of whence you be I know but who I can tell Alexander I be the sister of Theagines who fight a battle with thy father before the city of Chyeronie where he die I say which none can gainsay valiant lady there seem in your word spark of your brother deed but worse fortune in your life than his death but fear not for you shall live without violence enemy or necessity but what be you fair lady another sister to Theagines no sister to Theagines but a humble handmaid to Alexander bear of a mean parentage but to extreme fortune well lady for so your virtue show you whatsoever your birth be you shall|be honourable entreat Athens shall|be your Thebes and you shall not be as abject of war but as subject to Alexander Parmenio conduct these honourable lady into the city charge the soldier not so much as in word to offer they any offence and let all want be supply so far forth as shall|be necessary for such person and my prisoner Hephestion it rest now that we have as great care to govern in peace as conquer in war that while arm cease art may flourish and join letter with lance we endeavour to be as good philosopher as soldier know it no less praise to be wise than commendable to be valiant your majesty therein show that you have as great desire to rule as to subdue and needs must that common wealth be fortunate who captain be a philosopher and who philosopher be a captain I serve in steed of a master a mouse who house be a tub who dinner be a crust and who board be a bed then be thou in a state of life which philosopher commend a crumb for thy supper a hand for thy cup and thy clothes for thy sheet for natura paucis contenta Manes it be pity so proper a man shall be cast away upon a philosopher but that Diogenes that dog shall have mane that dogbolte it grieve nature and spite art the one have find the so dissolute absolute I will say in body the other so single singular in mind be you merry it be a sign by the trip of your tongue and the toy of your head that you have do that today which I have not do these three day what|be that dine I think Diogenes keep but cold cheer I will it be so but he keep neither hot nor cold what then luke warm that make mane run from his master last day Manes have reason for his name foretell as much my name how so sir boy you know that it be call mons à movendo because it stand still good and thou be name manes à manendo because thou run away pass reason I do not run away but retire to a prison because thou will have leisure to contemplate I will prove that my body be immortal because it be in prison as how do your master never teach you that the soul be immortal yes and the body be the prison of the soul true why then thus to make my body immortal I put it to prison o bad excellent ill you may see how dull a fast wit be therefore Psyllus let we go to supper with Granichus Plato be the best fellow of all philosopher give i he that read in the morning in the school and at noon in the kitchen and i ah sir my master be a king in his parlour for the body and a god in his study for the soul among all his man he commend one that be a excellent musician then stand I by and clap another on the shoulder and say this be a pass good cook it be well do Granichus for give i pleasure that go in at the mouth not the ear I have rather fill my gut than my brain I serve Apelles who feed i as Diogenes do manes for at dinner the one preach abstinence the other commend counterfeit when I will eat meat he paint a spit and when I thirst oh faith he be not this a fair pot and point to a table which contain the banquet of the god where be many dish to feed the eye but not to fill the gut what do thou then this do he then bring in many example that some have live by favour and prove that much easy it be to fat by colour and tell of bird that have be fat by paint grape in winter and how many have so feed their eye with their mistress picture that they never desire to take food be glut with the delight in their favour then do he show i counterfeit such as have forfeit with their filthy and loathsome vomit and with the riotous Bacchanal of the god Bacchus and his disorderly crew which be paint all to the life in his shop to conclude I fare hardly though I go rich which make i when I shall begin to shadow a lady face to draw a lamb head and sometime to set to the body of a maid a shoulder of mutton for semper animus meus est in patinis thou be a god to i for can I see but a cook shop paint I will make my eye fat as butter for I have nought but sentence to fill my maw as plures occidit crapula quàm gladius musateiunantibus amica repletion kill delicate and a old saw of abstinence Socrates the belly be the head grave thus with say not with meat he make a gallimaufry but how do thou then live with fine jest sweet air and the dog alm well for this time I will staunch thy gut and among pot and platter thou shall see what it be to serve Plato for joy of Granichus let|we sing my voice be as clear in the evening as in the morning another commodity of emptiness I have never such ado to warn scholar to come before a king first I come to Chrysippus a tall lean old mad man will he present to appear before Alexander he stand stare on my face neither move his eye nor his body I urge he to give some answer he take up a book sit down and say nothing Melissa his maid tell i it be his manner and that oftentimes she be fain to thrust meat in to his mouth for that he will rather starve than cease study well think I see bookish man be so blockish and so great clerk such simple courtier I will neither be partaker of their commons nor their commendation from thence I come to Plato and to Aristotle and to diverse other none refuse to come save a old obscure fellow who sit in a tub turn towards the son read greek to a young boy he when I will to appear before Alexander he answer if Alexander will fain see i let he come to i if learn of i let he come to i whatsoever it be let he come to i why say I he be a king he answer why I be a philosopher why but he be Alexander I but I be Diogenes I be half angry to see one so crooked in his shape to be so crabbed in his say So go my way I say thou shall repent it if thou come not to Alexander nay smile answer he Alexander may repent it if he come not to Diogenes virtue must be seek not offer and so turn himself to his cell he grunt I know not what like a pig under a tub but I must be go the philosopher be come it be a difficult controversy Aristotle and rather to be wonder at then believe how natural cause shall work supernal effect I do not so much stand upon the apparition be see in the moon neither the demonium of Socrates as that I can by natural reason give any reason of the ebb and flow of the sea which make i in the depth of my study to cry out oh ens entium miserere mei Cleanthes and you attribute so much to nature by search for thing which be not to be find that while you study a cause of your own you omit the occasion itself there be no man so savage in who rest not this divine particle that there be a omnipotent eternal and divine mover which may be call God I be of this mind that that first mover which you term God be the instrument of all the moving which we attribute to nature the earth which be mass swim on the sea season divide in themselves fruit grow in themselves the majesty of the sky the whole firmament of the world and whatsoever else appear miraculous what man almost of mean capacity but can prove it natural these cause shall|be debate at our philosopher feast in which controversy I will take part with Aristotle that there be naturanaturans and yet not God and I with Plato that there be deus optimus maximus and not nature here come Alexander I see Hephestion that these philosopher be here attend for we they be not philosopher if they know not their duty but I much marvel Diogenes shall be so dogged I do not think but his excuse will be better than melippus message I will go see he Hephestion because I long to see he that will command Alexander to come to who all the world be like to come Aristotle and the rest sithence my come from Thebes to Athens from a place of conquest to a palace of quiet I have resolve with myself in my court to have as many philosopher as I have in my camp soldier my court shall|be a school wherein I will have use as great doctrine in peace as I do in war discipline we be all here ready to be command and glad we be that we be command for that nothing better become king then literature which make they come as near to the god in wisdom as they do in dignity it be so Aristotle but yet there be among you yea and of your bring up that seek to destroy Alexander Calisthenes Aristotle who treason against his prince shall not be bear out with the reason of his philosophy if ever mischief enter into the heart of Calisthenes let Calisthenes suffer for it but that Aristotle ever imagine any such thing of Calisthenes Aristotle do deny well Aristotle kindred may blind thou and affection i but in king cause I will not stand to scholar argument this meeting shall|be for a commandment that you all frequent my court instruct the young with rule confirm the old with reason let your life be answerable to your learn jest my proceed be contrary to my promise you say you will ask every one of they a question which yesternight none of we can answer I will Plato of all beast which be the subtle that which man hitherto never know Aristotle how shall a man be think a god in do a thing unpossible for a man Crisyppus which be first the day or the night the day by a day in deed strange question must have strange answer Cleanthes what say you be life or death the strong life that suffer so many trouble Crates how long shall a man live till he think it better to die then live Anaxarchus whether do the sea or the earth bring forth most creature the earth for the sea be but a part of the earth Hephestion methinks they have answer all well and in such question I mean often to try they it be better to have in your court a wise man then in your ground a golden i therefore will I lean war to study wisdom be I Alexander so will I be I Hephestion but come let we go and give release as I promise to our Theban thrall thou be fortunate Aristotle that Alexander be thy scholar and all you happy that he be your sovereign I can like the man well if he can be content to be but a man he seek to draw near to the god in knowledge not to be a God let we question a little with Diogenes why he go not with we to Alexander Diogenes thou do forget thy duty that thou go not with we to the king and you your profession that you go to the king thou take as great pride to be peevish as other do glory to be virtuous and thou as great honour be a philosopher to be think courtlike as other shame that be courtier to be account philosopher these austere manner set aside it be well know that thou do counterfeit money and thou thy manner in that thou do not counterfeit money thou have reason to contemn the court be both in body and mind too crooked for a courtier as good be crooked and endeavour to make myself straight from the court as to be straight and learn to be crooked at the court thou think it a grace to be opposite against Alexander and thou to be jump with Alexander let we go for in contemn he we shall better please he then in wonder at he Plato what do thou think of Diogenes to be Socrates furious let we go
