boy till you be call Hephestion how do you like the sweet face of Campaspe I can but commend the stout courage of Timeclea without doubt Campaspe have some great man to her father you know Timoclea have Theagines to her brother Timoclea still in thy mouth be thou not in love not I not with Timoclea you mean wherein you resemble the lapwing who cry most where her nest be not and so you lead i from espy your love with Campaspe you cry Timoclea can I aswell subdue kingdom as I can my thought or be I as far from ambition as I be from love all the world will account i as valiant in arm as I know myself moderate in affection be love a vice it be no virtue well now shall thou see what small difference I make between Alexander and Hephestion and sith thou have be always partaker of my triumph thou shall be partaker of my torment I love Hephestion I love I love Campaspe a thing far unfit for a macedonian for a king for Alexander why hang thou down thy head Hephestion blush to hear that which I be not ashamed to tell may my word crave pardon and my counsel credit I will both discharge the duty of a subject for so I be and the office of a friend for so I will speak Hephestion for whatsoever be speak Hephestion speak to Alexander I can tell Alexander whether the report be more shameful to be hear or the cause sorrowful to be believe what be the son of Philip king of Macedon become the subject of Campaspe the captive of Thebes be that mind who greatness the world can not contain draw within the compass of a idle allure eye Will you handle the spindle with Hercules when you shall shake the spear with Achilles be the warlike sound of drum and trump turn to the soft noise of lyre and lute the neigh of barb steed who loudness fill the air with terror and who breathe dim the sun with smoke convert to delicate tune and amorous glance o Alexander that soft and yield mind shall not be in he who hard and unconquered heart have make so many yield but you love ah grief but who Campaspe ah shame a maid forsooth unknown unnoble and who can tell whether immodest who eye be frame by art to enamour and who heart be make by nature to enchant ay but she be beautiful yea but not therefore chaste ay but she be comely in all part of the body yea but she may be crooked in some part of the mind ay but she be wise yea but she be a woman beauty be like the blackberry which seem red when it be not ripe resemble precious stone that be polish with honey which the smoth they look the soon they break it be think wonderful among the sea man that mugil of all fish the swift be find in the belly of the bret of all the slow and shall it not seem monstrous to wise man that the heart of the great conqueror of the world shall be find in the hand of the weak creature of nature of a woman of a captive hermine have fair skin but foul liver sepulchre fresh colour but rot bone woman fair face but false heart Remember Alexander thou haste a camp to govern not a chamber fall not from the armour of Mars to the arm of Venus from the fiery assault of war to the maidenly skirmish of love from display the eagle in thy ensign to set down the sparrow I sigh Alexander that where fortune can not conquer folly shall overcome but behold all the perfection that may be in Campaspe a hair curl by nature not art sweet allure eye a fair face make in despite of Venus and a stately port in disdain of Juno a wit apt to conceive and quick to answer a skin as soft as silk and as smooth as jet a long white hand a fine little foot to conclude all part answerable to the best part what of this though she have heavenly gift virtue and beauty be she not of earthly metal flesh and blood you Alexander that will be a God show yourself in this worse than a man so soon to be both oversee and overtake in a woman who false tear know their true time who smooth word wound deep than sharp sword there be no surfeit so dangerous as that of honey nor any poison so deadly as that of love in the one physic can prevail nor in the other counsel my case be light Hephestion and not worthy to be call love if reason be a remedy or sentence can salve that sense can conceive little do you know and therefore slight do you regard the dead ember in a private person or live coal in a great prince who passion and thought do as far exceed other in extremity as their calling do in majesty a eclipse in the sun be more than the fall of a star none can conceive the torment of a king unless he be a king who desire be not inferior to their dignity and then judge Hephestion if the agony of love be dangerous in a subject whether they be not more than deadly unto Alexander who deep and not to be conceive sigh cleave the heart in shiver who wound thought can neither be express nor endure cease then Hephestion with argument to seek to refel that which with their deity the god can resist and let this suffice to answer thou that it be a king that love and Alexander who affection be not to be measure by reason be immortal nor I fear i to be bear be intolerable I must needs yield when neither reason nor counsel can be hear yield Hephestion for Alexander do love and therefore must obtain suppose she love not you affection come not by appointment or birth and then as good hate as enforce I be a king and will command you may to yield to lust by force but to consent to love by fear you can why what be that which Alexander may not conquer as he list why that which you say the god can resist love I be a conqueror she a captive I as fortunate as she fair my greatness may answer her want and the gift of my mind the modesty of she be it not likely then that she shall love be it not reasonable you say that in love there be no reason and therefore there can be no likelihood no more Hephestion in this case I will use my own counsel and in all other thy advice thou may be a good soldier but never good lover call my page sirrah go present to Apelles and will he to come to i without either delay or excuse I go in the mean season to recreate my spirit be so near we will go see Diogenes and see where his tub be Diogenes who call Alexander how happen it that you will not come out of your tub to my palace because it be as far from my tub to your palace as from your palace to my tub why then do thou owe no reverence to king no why so because they be no god they be god of the earth yea god of earth Plato be not of thy mind I be glad of it why because I will have none of Diogenes mind but Diogenes if Alexander have any thing that may pleasure Diogenes let i know and take it then take not from i that you can give i the light of the world what do thou want nothing that you have I have the world at command and I in contempt thou shall live no long than I will but I shall die whether you will or no how shall one learn to be content unlearn to covet Hephestion be I not Alexander I will wish to be Diogenes he be dog but discrete I can tell how sharp with a kind of sweetness full of wit yet too too wayward Diogenes when I come this way again I will both see thou and confer with thou do but here come Apelles how now Apelles be Venus face yet finish not yet beauty be not so soon shadow who perfection come not within the compass either of cunning or of colour well let it rest unperfect and come you with i where I will show you that finish by nature that you have be trifle about by art
