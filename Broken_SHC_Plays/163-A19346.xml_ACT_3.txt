other by the sight remove that object of my hate thy sword thou will be hear of she thou mean to kill I do obey yet with the same desire to die by thou for from my affection never expect a cowardly

the injury receive I hold my hand and blame myself for too much violence and without doubt thy beauty have over sway have I not cast in balance that a man dishonour never can be worthy thou that she who love i when my fame stand clear will hate i stain with infamy it|be true I do thou a affront and it|be as true I ought to do it both to save my honour and merit thou but have thus acquit my father and myself it|be only you that I now come to satisfy and make a present of my blood I know the thought of a slay father arm thy hate against i nor will I rob thou of thy sacrifice here offer to the

punish it though love speak to thou in my favour yet the bravery of thy mind ought to answer i which trust i my Cimena can be if to revenge thou borrow other hand for my revenge I use none but my own and thou for thou must use thy hand alone cruel to be so obstinate in this if without help thou do revenge thyself why do thou offer|it i I|will follow thou my courage be too great to let thou bear the least part in my glory neither shall i or my father honour stoop so low as to thy love or thy despair to owe hard point of honour can I by no way obtain this grace punish i in the name of thy dead father or our dear love either do|it in revenge or else in pity it|will to thy lover prove a gentle fate to die thus by thy hand than to live with thy hate away I hate thou not thou ought to hate i I can|it but fear thou not the blame and scandal which man will raise when they shall know my crime and the continuance of thy love no rather force they to silence and without more word by my death give thy reputation life it will live better if I let thou live I|will have the voice of the most black mouth envy admire my glory and pity my hard suffering when they shall know that though I love thy person I prosecute thy crime go Roderigo and let the darkness of the night conceal thy part hence my honour can run a great hazard than if man shall know that I have keep thou company so long it|be death to hear this away but what be you resolve to do spite of this love fire which will restrain that of my anger I shall do my best to have full vengeance for my father death and yet in spite of this so cruel honour my desire be to have my desire cross o miracle of love but heap with grief how many tear will these our father cost we who will have think it Roderigo who Cimena will have say it that our joy shall be so nigh we and so quick lose and that so near the port a sudden storm shall shipwreck all our hope go Roderigo and think I can dare not hear thou long I go then to draw out a die

friend within my house who hear of the affront be give i offer their life to vindicate my honour thou have prevent they but their brave valour will better be employ against the moor go march in|the head of they where honour call thou impeach the land of the enemy and if thou must seek death go find it there but rather crown with victory return and by thy valour force even justice self to pardon and Cimena to be silent if thou do love she think thy come home a conqueror must regain her heart or nothing but time|be too precious to be spend in talk I stay thou in discourse when thou shall fly come follow i to my house let the king see what he have lose in|the count he have find in thou
