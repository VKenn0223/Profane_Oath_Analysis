imperious to Cupid somewhat stately if you ask the cause in choler sic volo sic iubeo if in courtesy quae venu ex merito poena dolenda venit they be disdainful and have their desert thou Ceres do but govern the gut of man I the heart thou seek to starve Erisychthon with thy minister famine who his daughter shall preserve by my virtue love thou be but a god Cupid no Ceres but such a god as make thunder fall out of jove hand by throw thought into his heart and to be more terrify with the sparkle of a lady eye than man with the flash of his lightning such a god that have kindle more fire in Neptune bosom than the whole sea which he be king of can quench such power have I that Pluto never die fire do but scorch in respect of my flame Diana have feel some motion of love Vesta do Ceres shall be thou so cruel to those that resist a lion to those that submit a lamb can thou make such difference in affection and yet shall it all be love yea as much as between sickness and health though in both be life those that yield and honour Cupid shall possess sweet thought and enjoy please wish the other shall be torment with vain imagination and impossible hope how may my nymph be restore if thou restore Erisychthon they embrace their love and all offer sacrifice to i Erisychthon do in contempt hew down my sacred tree thy nymph do in disdain scorn my constant love he slay most cruel my chaste Fidelia who blood lie yet on the ground but Diana have change her blood to fresh flower which be to be see on the ground what honour shall he do to Ceres what amends can he make to Fidelia all Ceres grove shall he deck with garland and account every tree holy a stately monument shall he erect in remembrance of Fidelia and offer yearly sacrifice what sacrifice shall I and my nymph offer thou for I will do any thing to restore my nymph and honour thou you shall present in honour of my mother Venus grape and wheat for sine cerere & baccho friget Venus you shall suffer your nymph to play sometime to be idle in the favour of Cupid for otiasitollas periere cupidinis arcu so much for Ceres thy nymph shall make no vow to continue virgin nor use word to disgrace love nor fly from opportunity that kindle affection if they be chaste let they not be cruel if fair not proud if love not inconstant cruelty be for tiger pride for peacock inconstancy for fool Cupid I yield and they shall but sweet Cupid let they not be deceive by flattery which take the shape of affection nor by lust which be clothe in the habit of love for man have as many slight to delude as they have word to speak those that practise deceit shall perish Cupid favour none but the faithful well I will go to Erisychthon and bring he before thou then shall thy nymph recover their fame so as they yield to love they shall a strange discourse Protea by which I find the god amorous and virgin immortal goddess full of cruelty and man of unhappiness I have tell both my father misfortune grow by stoutness and i by weakness his thwart of Ceres my yield to Neptune I know Protea that hard iron fall into fire wax soft and then the tender heart of a virgin be in love must needs melt for what shall a fair young and witty lady answer to the sweet enticement of love but I have hear too that heart of man stiff than steel have by love be make soft than wool and then they cry man have often feign sigh and woman forge tear suppose I love not suppose I care not if man swear and lie how will you try their love if woman swear they love how will you try their dissemble the god put wit into woman and nature deceit into man I do this but to try your patience nor I but to prove your faith but see Petulius what miraculous punishment here be for desert in love this rock be a nymph to Ceres so be this rose so that bird all change from their shape all change by Cupid because they disdain love or dissemble in it a fair warn to Protea I hope she will love without dissemble a item for Petulius that he delude not those that love he for Cupid can also change man let we in This go lucky that Cupid have promise to restore our mistress and Ceres that they shall accept our love I do ever imagine that true love will end with sweet joy though so be begin with deep sigh but how shall we look on they when we shall see they smile we must and perchance they will frown push let we endure the bend of their fair brow and the scorch of their sparkle eye so that we may possess at last the depth of their affection possess never doubt it for Ceres have restore Erisychthon and therefore will persuade with they nay command they if it come by commandment of Ceres not their own motion I rather they shall hate for what joy can there be in our life or in our love sweetness when every kiss shall be seal with a curse and every kind word proceed of fear not affection enforcement be worse than enchantment be thou so superstitious in love that be wont to be most careless let they curse all day so I may have but one kiss at night thou be worse than Silvestris he not content without absolute love thou with indifferent but here come Ceres with Erisychthon let we look demure for in her heart she hate we deep I will hallow thy wood with solemn feast and honour all thy nymph with due regard well do so and thank Cupid that command nay thank my foolish nymph that know not how to obey here be the lover ready at receipt how now gentleman what seek you nothing but what Ceres will find Ceres have find those that I will she have lose vain lover Ceres may lose that that Cupid will save true lover you think so one

embrace these lover who wither out their youth honour be mighty Cupid that make i live honour be mighty Cupid that make i love and i what more lover yet I think it be impossible for Ceres to have any follow she in one hour that be not in love in the next Erisychthon be thou careful to honour Ceres and forget not to please her nymph the faithful love of thy daughter Protea have wrought both pity in i to grant her desire and to release thy punishment thou Petulius shall enjoy thy love because I know thou loyal then shall Petulius be most happy and Protea most fortunate but do you Ramis continue your constant love and you Montanus and you Silvestris nothing can alter our affection which increase while the mean decrease and wax strong in be weaken then Venus send down that shower wherewith
