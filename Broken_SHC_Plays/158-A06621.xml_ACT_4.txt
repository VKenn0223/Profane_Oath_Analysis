Pan will thou contend with Apollo who tune the heaven and make they all hang by harmony Orpheus that cause tree to move with the sweetness of his harp offer yearly homage to my lute so do Arion that bring dolphin to his sugar note and Amphion that by music rear the wall of Thebes only pan with his harsh whistle which make beast shake for fear not man dance for joy seek to compare with Apollo Pan be a god Apollo be no more comparison can be odious where the deity be equal this pipe my sweet pipe be once a nymph a fair nymph once my lovely mistress now my heavenly music tell i Apollo be there any instrument so sweet to play on as one mistress have thy lute be of laurel and the string of Daphne hair thy tune may have be compare to my note for then Daphne will have add to thy stroke sweetness and to thy thought melody do pan talk of the passion of love of the passion of divine love o how that word Daphne wound Apollo pronounce by the barbarous mouth of pan I fear his breath will blast the fair green if I dazzle not his eye that he may not behold it thy pipe a nymph some hag rather haunt these shady grove and desire not thy love but the fellowship of such a monster what God be pan but the god of beast of wood and hill exclude from heaven and in earth not honour break thy pipe or with my sweet lute will I break thy heart let not love enter into those savage lip a word for jove for Apollo for the heavenly god who thought be god and god be all love Apollo I tell thou before that pan be a God I tell thou now again as great a god as Apollo I have almost say a great and because thou shall know I care not to tell my thought I say a great Pan feel the passion of love deep engrave in his heart with as fair nymph with as great fortune as Apollo as Neptune as jove and better than pan can none describe love not Apollo not Neptune not jove my temple be in arcady where they burn continual flame to pan in arcady be my oracle where Erato the nymph give answer for pan in arcady the place of love be the honour of pan I but I be God of hill so I be Apollo and that of hill so high as I can pry into the juggle of the high god of wood so I be Apollo of wood so thick that thou with thy beam can not pierce they I know Apollo pry I know my own jealousy sun and shadow cousin one another be thou sun still the shadow be fast at thy heel Apollo i as near to thy love as thou to i a carter with his whistle and his whip in true ear move as much as Phoebus with his fiery chariot and wing horse love-leaf be as well for country porridge as heavenly nectar love make jupiter a goose and Neptune a swine and both for love of a earthly mistress what have make pan or any God on earth for god on earth can change their shape turn themselves for a heavenly goddess believe i Apollo our grove be pleasant than your heaven our milkmaid than your goddess our rude ditty to a pipe than your sonnet to a lute here be flat faith amo amas where you cry o utinam amarent vel non amassem I let pass Apollo thy hard word as call pan monster which be as much as to call all monster for pan be all Apollo but one but touch thy string and let these nymph decide those nymph shall decide unless thy rude speech have make they deaf as for any other answer to pan take this that it become not Apollo to answer pan Pan be all and all be pan thou be pan and all all pan and tinkerly but to this music wherein all thy shame shall be see and all my skill in the chase I lose all my company and miss the game too I think Midas shall in all thing be unfortunate what be he that talk Midas the unfortunate king of Phrygia to be a king be next be to a God thy fortune be not bad what be thy folly to abuse a God a ungrateful part of a king but Midas see by chance thou be come or send by some god of purpose none can in the earth better judge of god than king sit down with these nymph I be Apollo this pan both god we contend for sovereignty in music see it happen in earth we must be judge of those on earth in which there be none more worthy than king and nymph therefore give ear that thy judgement err not if god you be although I dare wish nothing of God be so deep wound with wish yet let my judgement prevail before these nymph if we agree not because I be a king there must be no condition but judge Midas and judge nymph then thus I begin both my song and my play oh divine Apollo o sweet consent if the god of music shall not be above our reach who shall I like it not now let i tune my pipe I can pipe and sing that|be the odds in the instrument not the art but I will pipe and then sing and then judge both of the art and instrument have thou do Pan ay and do well as I think now nymph what say you we all say that Apollo have show himself both a god and of music the god pan himself a rude satire neither keep measure nor time his pipe as far out of tune as his body out of form to thou divine Apollo we give the prize and reverence but what say Midas methinks there|be more sweetness in the pipe of pan than Apollo lute I brook not that nice tickle of string that content i that make one start what a shrillness come into my ear out of that pipe and what a goodly noise it make Apollo I must needs judge that pan deserve most praise bless be Midas worthy to be a God these girl who ear do but itch with daintiness gene the verdict without weigh the virtue they have be bring up in chamber with soft music not where I make the wood ring with my pipe Midas wretched unworthy to be a king thou shall know what it be to displease Apollo I will leave thou but the two last letter of they name to be thy whole name which if thou can not guess touch thy care they shall tell thou what have thou do Apollo the ear of a ass upon the head of a king and well worthy when the dulness of a ass be in the ear of a king help pan or Midas perish I can undo what Apollo have do nor give thou any amends unless to those ear thou will have add these horn it be very well that it may be hard to judge whether he be more ox or ass farewell Midas Midas farewell I warrant they be dainty ear nothing can please they but Pan pipe he have the advantage of all ear except the mouse for else there|be none so sharp of hear as the ass farewell Midas Midas farewell farewell Midas ah Midas why be not thy whole body metamorphose that there may have be no part leave of Midas where shall I shroud this shame or how may I be restore to my old shape Apollo be angry blame not Apollo who be god of music thou do both dislike and dishonour prefer the barbarous noise of Pan pipe before the sweet melody of Apollo lute if I return to Phrygia I shall be point at if live in these wood savage beast must be my companion and what other companion shall Midas hope for than beast be of all beast himself the dull have it not be better for thou to have perish by a golden death than now to lead a beastly life unfortunate in thy wish unwise in thy judgement first a golden fool now a leaden ass what will they say in Lesbos if happy these news come to Lesbos if they come Midas yes report fly as swift as thought gather wing in the air and double rumour by her own run insomuch as have here the ear of a ass it will there be tell all my hair be ass ear then will this be the byword be Midas that seek to be monarch of the world become the mock of the world be his golden mine turn into water as free for every one that will fetch as for himself that possess they by wish ah poor Midas be his conceit become blockish his counsel unfortunate his judgement unskilful ah foolish Midas a just reward for thy pride to wax poor for thy overween to wax dull for thy ambition to wax humble for thy cruelty to say sisque miser semper nec sis miserabilis ulli but I must seek to cover my shame by art least be once discover to these petty king of Mysia Pisidia and Galatia they all join to add to my ass ear of all the beast the dull a sheep heart of all the beast the fearful and so cast lot for those kingdom that I have win with so many life and keep with so many envy I muse what the nymph mean that so sing in the grove Midas of Phrygia have ass ear I marvel not for one of they plain tell i he have ass ear ay but it be not safe to say it he be a great king and his hand be long than his ear therefore forus that keep sheep it be wisdom enough to tell sheep it|be true yet since Midas grow so mischievous as to blur his diadem with blood which shall glister with nothing but pity and so miserable that he make gold his god that be frame to be his slave many broad speech have fly abroad in his own country they stick not to call he tyrant and else where usurper they flat say that he eat into other dominion as the sea do into the land not know that in swallow a poor island as big as Lesbos he may cast up three territory thrice as big as Phrygia for what the sea win in the marsh it lose in the sand take i with you but speak soft for these reed may have ear and hear we suppose they have yet they may be without tongue to bewray we nay let they have tongue too we have eye to see that they have none and therefore if they hear and speak they know not from whence it come well than this I say when a lion do so much degenerate from princely kind that he will borrow of the beast I say he be no lion but a monster piece with the craftiness of the fox the cruelty of the tiger the raven of the wolf the dissemble of hyena he be worthy also to have the ear of a ass he seek to conquer Lesbos and like a foolish gamester have a bagful of his own venture it all to win a groat of another he that fish for Lesbos must have such a wooden net as all the tree in Phrygia will not serve to make the cod nor all the wood in Pisidia provide the cork nay he mean to angle for it with a hook of gold and a bait of gold and so to strike the fish with a please bait that will slide out of a open net tush tush those islander be too subtle to nibble at craft and too richet to swallow treasure if that be his hope he may as well dive to the bottom of the sea and bring up a anchor of a thousand weight as plod with his gold to corrupt a people so wise and beside a nation as I have hear so valiant that be ready to strike than ward more than all this Amintas though we dare not so much as mutter it their king be such a one as dazzle the clear eye with majesty daunt the valiant heart with courage and for virtue fill all the world with wonder if beauty go beyond sight confidence above valour and virtue exceed miracle what be it to be think but that Midas go to undermine that by the simplicity of man that be fasten to a rock by the providence of the god we poor commons who taste war be make to relish nothing but tax can do nothing but grieve to see thing unlawful practise to obtain thing impossible all his mine do but gild his comb to make it glister in the war and cut we that be force to follow he in his war well that must be bear not blame that can be change for my part if I may enjoy the fleece of my silly flock with quietness I will never care three flock for his ambition let this suffice we may talk too much and be overhear be all undo I be so jealous that methinks the very reed bow down as though they listen to our talk and soft I hear some come let we in and meet at a place more meet be not hunt a tedious occupation I and troublesome for if you call a dog a dog you be undo you be both fool and beside base-minded hunt be for king not peasant such as you be unworthy to be hound much less huntsman that know not when a hound be fleet fair flewed and well hang be ignorant of the deepness of a hound mouth and the sweetness why I hope sir a cur mouth be no deep than the sea nor sweet than a honey comb pretty coxcomb a hound will swallow thou as easy as a great pit a small pibble Indeed hunt be a pleasant sport but the dog make such bark that one can hear the hound cry I|will make thou cry if I catch thou in the forest thou shall be leash what|be that do thou not understand their language not I it|be the best calamance in the world as easy decipher as the character in a nutmeg I pray thou speak some I will but speak in order or I|will pay you to it Petulus there be a boy leash on the single because when he be emboss he take soil what|be that why a boy be beat on the tail with a leathern thong because when he foam at the mouth with run he go into the water this be worse than fustian mum you be best hunt be a honourable pastime and for my part I have as lief hunt a dear in a park as court a lady in a chamber give i a pastry for a park and let i shake off a whole kennel of tooth for hound then shall thou see a notable champ after that will I carouse a bowl of wine and so in the stomach let the venison take soil he have lay the plot to be prudent why it|be pastry crust eat enough and it will make you wise a old proverb ay and eloquent for you must tipple wine free & foecundi calices quem non fecere disertum fecere dizardum leave off these toy and let we seek out Midas who we lose in the chase I|will warrant he have by this start a covey of Buck or rouse a scull of pheasant treason to two brave sport hawk and hunt thou shall say start a hare rouse the dear spring the partridge I|will warrant that be devise by some country swad that see a hare skip up which make he start he present say he start the hare ay and some lubber lie beside a spring and see a partridge come by say he do spring the partridge well remember all this Remember all nay then have we good memory for there be more phrase than thou have hair but let i see I pray thou what|be this about thy neck a bugle if it have stand on thy head I shall have call it a horn well it|be hard to have one brow embroider with bugle but can thou blow it what else but not away no it|will make Boreas out of breath to blow his horn away there be good blow I|will warrant before they come there well it|be a shroud blow spare your wind in this or I|will wind your neck in a cord but soft I hear my master blast some have feel it thy mother when such a fly blow be buzz out but I must be go I perceive Midas be come Ex. then let not we tarry for now shall we shave the barber house the world will grow full of wile see Midas have lose his golden wish I care not my head shall dig devise and my tongue stamp they so as my mouth shall be a mint and my brain a my then help we to cozen the barber the barber shall know every hair of my chin to be as good as a choke-pear for his purse I marvel what Midas mean to be so melancholy since his hunt it be a good word in Midas otherwise I shall term it in another blockishness I can tell whether it be a sourness common incident to age or a severeness particular to the king of Phrygia or a suspicion cleave to great estate but methinks he seem so jealous of we all and become so overthwart to all other that either I must conjecture his wit be not his own or his meaning very hard to some for my part I neither care nor wonder I see all his expedition for war be lay in water for now when he shall execute he begin to consult and suffer the enemy to bid we good morrow at our own door to who we long since may have give the last good night in their own bed he wear I know not whether for warmth or wantonness a great tiara on his head as though his head be not heavy enough unless he load it with great roll a attire never use that I can hear of but of old woman or pelt priest this will make Pisidia wanton Lycaonia stiff all his territory waver and he that have couch so many kingdom in one crown will have his kingdom scatter into as many crown as he possess country I will rouse he up and if his ear be not ass ear I will make they tingle I respect not my life I know it be my duty and certain I dare swear war be my profession Martius we will all join and though I have be as in Phrygia they term a brave courtier that be as they expound it a fine lover yet will I set both aside love and court and follow Martius for never shall it be say bella gerant alij semper Eristus amet and I Martius that honour gold for a god and account all other god but lead will follow Martius and say Vilius argentum est aurum virtutibus aurum my lord I give you thanks and be glad for there be no stout soldier in the world than those that be make of lover nor any more liberal in war than they that in peace have be covetous then doubt not if courage and coin can prevail but we shall prevail and beside nothing can prevail but fortune but here come Sophronia I will first talk with she enter Sophronia Camilla Amerula madam either our king have no ear to hear or no care to consider both in what state we stand be his subject and what danger he be in be our king duty be not regard courage contemn altogether careless of we and his own safety Martius I mislike not thy plain deal but pity my father trance a trance I must call that where nature can move nor counsel nor music nor physic nor danger nor death nor all but that which make i most both to sorrow and wonder be that music a mithridate for melancholy shall make he mad cry still vno namque modo pan and Apollo nocent none have access to he but motto as though melancholy be to be shave with a razor not cure with a medicine but stay what noise be this in those reed what sound be this who dare utter that he hear I dare Mellacrites the word be plain Midas the king have ass ear this be strange and yet to be tell the king so dare I Camilla for it concern i in duty and we all in discretion but soft let we hearken better Midas of Phrygia have ass ear this be monstrous and either portend some mischief to the king or unto the state confusion Midas of Phrygia have ass ear it be unpossible let we with speed to the king to know his resolution for to some oracle he must send till his majesty be acquaint with this matter we dare not root out the reed himself must both hear the sound and guess at the reason unfortunate Midas that be so great a king there shall out of the earth spring so great a shame it may be that his wish for gold be but dross of the world be by all the god account foolish and so discover out of the earth for a king to thirst for gold in steed of honour to prefer heap of worldly coin before triumph in warlike conquest be in my mind no princely mind let we not debate the cause but seek to prevent the snare for in my mind it foretell that which wound my mind let we in
