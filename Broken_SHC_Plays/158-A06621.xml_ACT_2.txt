in Pactolus go bathe thy wish and thou thy wish the wave shall have and thou be free fair Caelia thou see of gold there be satiety of love there can if thou shall wish that whatsoever thou think may be love as Midas whatever he touch may be gold it may be love will be as loathsome to thy ear as gold be to his eye and make thy heart pinch with melancholy as his gut do with famine no sweet Caelia in love there be variety Indeed man vary in their love they vary their love yet change it not love and change be at variance therefore if they vary they must change Men change the manner of their love not the humour the mean how to obtain not the mistress they honour so do jupiter that can not entreat Danae by golden word possess his love by a golden shower not alter his affection but use art the same jupiter be a eagle a swan a bull and for every saint a new shape as man have for every mistress a new shadow if you take example of the god who more wanton more waver if of yourselves be but man who will think you more constant than god Eristus if gold can have allure my eye thou know Midas that command all thing to be gold have conquer if threat may have fear my heart Midas be a king may have command my affection if love gold or authority may have enchant i Midas have obtain by love gold and authority quorum si singula nostram flectere non poterant potuissent omnia mentem ah Caelia if king say they love and yet dissemble who dare say that they dissemble and not love they command the affection of other yield and their own to be believe my tear which have make furrow in my cheek and in my eye fountain my sigh which have make of my heart a furnace and kindle in my head flame my body that melt by piecemeal and my mind that pine at a instant may witness that my love be both unspotted and unspeakable quorum si singula duram flectere non poterant deberent omnia mentem but soft here come the princess with the rest of the lord Mellacrites I can tell whether I shall more mislike thy council or Midas consent but the covetous humour of you both I contemn and wonder at be unfit for a king who honour shall consist in liberality not greediness and unworthy the call of Mellacrites who fame shall rise by the soldier god mar not by the merchant god gold madam thing past can be recall but repent and therefore be rather to be pity than punish it now behoove we how to redress the miserable estate of our king not to dispute of the occasion your highness see and without grief you can see that his meat turn to massy gold in his mouth and his wine slide down his throat like liquid gold if he touch his robe they be turn to gold and what be not that touch he but become gold i Mellacrites if thy tongue have be turn to gold before thou give our king such council Midas heart have be full of ease and thy mouth of gold if my advice have take place Midas that now sit over head and ear in crown have wear upon his head many king crown and be conqueror of the world that now be commander of dross that greediness of Mellacrites who heartstring be make of Plutus purse-string have make Midas a lump of earth that shall be a god on earth and thy effeminate mind Eristus who eye be stitch on Celia face and thought guide to her beauty have breed in all the court such a tender wantonness that nothing be think of but love a passion proceed of beastly lust and colour with a courtly name of love thus while we follow the nature of thing we forget the name since this unsatiable thirst of gold and untemperate humour of lust creep into the king court soldier have beg alm of artificer and with their helmet on their head be glad to follow a lover with a glove in his hat which so much abate the courage of true captain that they must account it more honourable in the court to be a coward so rich and amorous than in a camp to be valiant if poor and maim he be more favour that prick his finger with his mistress needle than he that break his lance on his enemy face and he that have his mouth full of fair word than he that have his body full of deep scar if one be old and have silver hair on his beard so he have golden ruddock in his bag he must be wise and honourable if young and have curl lock on his head amorous glance with his eye smooth speech in his mouth every lady lap shall|be his pillow every lady face his glass every lady ear a sheath for his flattery only soldier if they be old must beg in their own country if young try the fortune of war in another he be the man that be let blood carry his arm in a scarf of his mistress favour not he that bear his leg on a stilt for his country safety stay Martius though I know love to grow to such looseness and hoard to such misery that I may rather grieve at both than remedy either yet thy animate my father to continual arm to conquer crown have only bring he into imminent danger of his own head the love he have follow I fear unnatural the riches he have get I know unmeasurable the war he have levy I doubt unlawful have draw his body with grey hair to the graves mouth and his mind with eat care to desperate determination ambition have but two step the low blood the high envy both these have my unhappy father climb dig mine of gold with the life of man and now envy of the whole world be environ with enemy round about the world not know that ambition have one heel nail in hell though she stretch her finger to touch the heaven I will the god will remove this punishment so that Midas will be penitent let he thrust thou Eristus with thy love into Italy where they honour lust for a God as the egyptian do dog thou Mellacrites with thy greediness of gold to the utmost part of the west where all the gut of the earth be gold and thou Martius that sound but blood and terror into those barbarous nation where nothing be to be find but blood and terror let Phrygia be a example of chastity not lust liberality not covetousness valour not tyranny I wish not your body banish but your mind that my father and your king may be our honour and the world wonder and thou Caelia and all you lady learn this of Sophronia that beauty in a minute be both a blossom and a blast love a worm which seem to live in the eye die in the heart you be all young and fair endeavour all to be wise and virtuous that when like rose you shall fall from the stalk you may be gather and put to the still madam I be free from love and unfortunate to be belove to be free from love be strange but to think scorn to be belove monstrous Eristus thy tongue do itch to talk of love and my ear tingle to hear it I charge you all if you owe any duty to your king to go present unto the temple of Bacchus offer praise-gift and sacrifice that Midas may be release of his wish or his life this I entreat you this Midas command you jar not with yourselves agree in one for your king if ever you take Midas for your lawful king madam we will go and omit nothing that duty may perform or pain go speedy lest Midas die before you return and you Caelia shall go with i that with talk we may beguile the time and my father think of no meat I attend ah my girl be not this a golden world it be all one as if it be lead with i and yet as golden with i as with the king for I see it and feel it not he feel it and enjoy it not gold be but the earth garbage a weed breed by the sun the very rubbish of barren ground tush Licio thou be unlettered all the earth be a egg the white silver the yolk gold why thou fool what hen shall lay that egg I warrant a goose nay I believe a bull Blirt to you both it be lay by the sun the sun be rather a cock than a hen it|be true girl else how can Titan have tread Daphne I weep over both your wit if I prove in every respect no difference between a egg and gold will you not then grant gold to be a egg yes but I believe thy idle imagination will make it a addle egg let we hear proceed doctor egg gold will|be crack a common say a crack crown i that|be a break head nay then I see thou have a break wit well suppose gold will crack so will a egg on a egg be roast in the fire well So be gold try in the fire forth a egg as physician say will make one lusty conclude and who know not that gold will make one frolic Pipenetta this be true for it be call egg as a thing that do egg on so do gold let we hear all egg potch be for a weak stomach and gold boil for a consume body speak like a physician or a fool of necessity a egg be eat at one sup and a portague lose at one cast gamester-like conclude egg make custard and gold make spoon to eat they a reason dough-baked o the oven of his wit be not thorough heat only this odds I find between money and egg which make i wonder that be more penny in the world than egg that one shall have three egg for a penny and not three penny for a egg a wonderful matter but your wisdom be overshoot in your comparison for egg have chicken gold have none mops I pity thou gold have egg change a angel into ten shilling and all those piece be the angel egg he have make a speak will thou eat a egg but soft here come our master let we shrink aside a short answer yet a sound Bacchus be pithy and pitiful I understand no oracle shall the water turn every thing to gold what then shall become of the fish shall he be free from gold what then shall become of we of his crown of our country I like not these riddle thou Martius be so warlike that thou will cut of the wish with a sword not cure it with a salve but the god that can give the desire of the heart can as easy withdraw the torment suppose Vulcan shall so temper thy sword that be thy heart never so valeant thy arm never so strong yet thy blade shall never draw blood will not thou wish to have a weak hand and a sharp edge yes if Mars shall answer thou thus go bathe thy sword in water and wash thy hand in milk and thy sword shall cleave adamant and thy heart answer the sharpness of thy sword will not thou try the conclusion what else then let Midas believe till he have try and think that the god rule as well by give remedy as grant wish but Eristus be mum Caelia have seal his mouth Caelia have seal her face in my heart which I be no more ashamed to confess than thou that Mars have make a scar in thy face Martius but let we in to the king sir boy you wait well we dare not go to Bacchus for if I see a grape my head ache and if I find a cudgel I|will make your shoulder ache and you Licio wait on yourself I can choose sir I be always so near myself I|will be as near you as your skin present
