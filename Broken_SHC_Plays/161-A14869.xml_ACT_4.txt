the merchant I will name he to you without either title or addition for those false beam of his suppose honour as void of true heat as be all paint fire or glow-worm in the dark suit he all base as if he have buy his gentry from the herald with money get by extortion I will first produce this Aesop crow as he stand forfeit for the long use of his gay borrow plume and then let he hop naked I come to|the point it|have be a dream in Naples very near this eight and thirty year that this Romelio be noble descend he have rank himself with the nobility shameful usurp their place and in a kind of saucy pride which like to mushroom ever grow most rank when they do spring from dunghill seek to oversway the Fliski the Grimaldi Dori and all the ancient pillar of our state view now what he be come

Romelio be a bastard how a bastard o mother now the day begin grow hot on your side why she be your accuser that|be not the business I turn i then to you that be my mother but by what name I be to call you now you must instruct i be you ever marry to my father to my shame I speak it never not to Franscisco Romelio may it please your lordship to he I be but he be not his father good my lord give we leave in a few word to expound the riddle and to make it plain without the least of scruple for I take it there can be more lawful proof in|the world than the oath of the mother well then to your proof and be not tedious I|will conclude in a word some nine and thirty year since which be the time this woman be marry Francisco Romelio this gentleman putative father and her husband be not marry to she past a fortnight will needs go travel do so and continue in France and the Low-countries eleven month take special note of|the time I beseech your lordship for it make much to|the business in his absence he leave behind to sojourn at his house a spanish gentleman a fine spruce youth by the lady confession and you may be sure he be no eunuch neither he be one Romelio love very dear as oft hap no man alive more welcome to the husband than he that make he cuckold this gentleman I say break all law of hospitality get his friend wife with child a full two month fore the husband return good sir forget not the lambskin I warrant thou I will pinch by the buttock to put you in mind of|it prithee hold thy prate what|be to be practise now my lord marry this Romelio be a young novice not acquaint with this precedence very innocent return home from travel find his wife grow a excellent good huswife for she have set her woman to spin flax and to that use have in a study which be build of stone store up at least a hundred weight of flax marry such a thread as be to be spin from the flax I think the like be never hear of what be that you may be certain she will lose no time in brag that her husband have get up her belly to be short at seven month end which be the time of her delivery and when she feel herself to fall in travel she make she wait woman as by mischance set fire to the flax the flight whereof as they pretend cause this gentlewoman to fall in pain and be deliver eight week afore her reckon now sir remember the lambskin the midwife straight howl out there be no hope of the|infants life swaddle it in a stead lambskin as a bird hatch too early make it up with three quarter of a face that make it look like a changeling cry out to Romelio to have it christen lest it shall depart without that it come for and thus be many serve that take care to get gossip for those child to which they may be godfather themselves and yet be no arch-puritan neither no more you have urge enough you first affirm her husband be away from her eleven month yes my lord and at seven month end after his return she be deliver of this Romelio and have go her full time true my lord so by this account this gentleman be beget in his suppose father absence you have it full a most strange suit this it|be beyond example either time past or present for a woman to publish she own dishonour voluntary without be call in question some forty year after the sin commit and her council to enlarge the offence with as much oratory as ever I do hear they in my life defend a guilty woman it|be most strange or why with such a poison violence shall she labour her son undo we observe obedience of creature to the law of nature be the stay of the whole world here that law be break for though our civil law make difference between the base and the legitimate compassionate nature make they equal nay she many time prefer they I pray resolve i sir have not you and your mother have some suit in law together late none my lord no no contention about part your good not any no flaw no unkindness none that ever arrive at my knowledge bethink yourself this can choose but savour of a woman malice deep and I fear you|be practise upon most devilish How happen gentlewoman you reveal this no soon while my husband live my lord I dare not I shall rather ask you why you reveal it now because my lord I loathe that such a sin shall lie smother with i in my grave my penitence though to my shame prefer the reveal of it above worldly reputation your penitence may not your penitence have be as hearty though it have never summon to the court such a conflux of people Indeed I may have confess it private tooth church I grant but you know repentance be nothing without satisfaction satisfaction why your husband|be dead what satisfaction can you make he the great satisfaction in the world my lord to restore the land tooth right heir and that|be my daughter o she|be straight beget then very well may it please this honourable court if he be a bastard and must forfeit his land for|it she have prove herself a strumpet and must lose her dower let they go beg together who shall pay we our fee

there be no reason as you say even now to satisfy i but this suit of she spring from a devilish malice and liar pretence of a grieve conscience and religion like to the horrid powder-treason in England have a most bloody unnatural revenge hide under it o the violence of woman why they be creature make up and compound of all monster poison mineral and sorcerous herb that grow be you angry yet will man express a bad one let he forsake all natural example and compare one to another they have no more mercy then ruinous fire in great tempest take heed you do not crack your voice sir hard heart creature good for nothing else but to wind dead body yes to weave seem lace with the bone of their yet why do I take bastardy so distasteful when in|the world a many thing that be essential part of greatness be but by-slip and be father on the wrong party preferment in the world a many time base beget nay I have observe the immaculate justice of a poor man cause in such a court as this have not know who to call father which way to direct itself for compassion but I forget my temper only that I may stop that lawyer throat I do beseech the court and the whole world they will not think the base of i for the vice of a mother for that woman sin to which you all dare swear when it be do I will not give my consent stay here|be a accusation but here|be no proof what be the Spaniard name you
