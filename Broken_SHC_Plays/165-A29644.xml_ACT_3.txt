guess afflict his mind but of what nature it be or how the strong conceit may grow they can by no mean win or wrest from he such be the obstinacy of his disease where be Theodrick then his bosom friend his special favourite he methinks may gain the knowledge of his inmost thought it|be think he put these wild torment thought into he for which the king have banish he the court and with a guard upon his person send he to live confine at his house myself and all the faithful body of the state have move the king for his repeal again to favour Even we that for these two year space have wish he for good state-reason favourless and headless have beg for his enlargement that the king may vent his trouble thought into his breast and so find way to ease but all in vain he will not hear of he you tell i wonder but good my lord how take the king his rest troth as mad mortal do we can tell whether he sleep at all or not sometime he seem to sleep but then his trouble thought express themselves in sigh in sudden start in groan and sometime speech of odd confuse and indigested matter then he leap from off his bed call for his horse and armour sword spear and battle-axe but anon bid all be let alone and call for book shoffel divinity and poetry philosophy and historical together sport and throw all by then call for merry which ever they be present he forbid with strong rebuke to all that spend their time in any exercise but contemplation in solitary place then walk forth into the grove and thicket charge those that follow he nor dare they disobey to keep aloof at such proportion distance as he unheard by all may vent his passion unto the air the wood the rock the spring and twice in these retirement have we lose he in those obscure meander which his melancholy have lead he to and when much industry and care have find he out it|be double trouble to wind he and his fancy home again full now my lord of a new fancy he be now become pilgrim I know not why nor to what shrine nor do I hold it fit to ask he but to give free way unto his fancy yet a while in all to please and play with his infirmity it|be our best way to cool frenetic humour before we kill they sir his
