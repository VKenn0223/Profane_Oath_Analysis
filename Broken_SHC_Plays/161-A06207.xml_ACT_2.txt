such another strange ill lay request as if a beggar shall entreat a king to leave his sceptre and his throne to he and take his rag to wander over the world hungry and cold Alas it|be of that nature that it must be utter ay and grant or I die I be ashamed to speak it but where life lie at the stake I can think her woman that will not take something unreasonable to hazard save of it I shall seem a strange petitioner that wish all ill to they I beg of ere they give i aught yet so I must I will you be not fair nor wise for in your ill consist my good if you be foolish you will hear my prayer if foul you have not power to hinder i he will not love you nay my request be more without the bound of reason yet for it|be not in the power of you to do what I will have you grant your brother bring a prince into this land of such a noble shape so sweet a grace so full of worth withal that every maid that look upon he give away herself to he for ever and for you to have he bring he and so mad be my demand that I desire you not to have this man this excellent man for who you needs must die if you shall miss he I do now expect you shall laugh at i trust i I can weep rather for I have find in all thy word a strange disjoint sorrow it|be by i his own desire too that you will not love he his own desire why credit i Thalestris I be no common wooer if he shall woo i his worth may be such that I dare not swear I will not love he but if he will stay to have i woo he I will promise thou he may keep all his grace to himself and fear no ravish from i it|be yet his own desire but when he see your face I fear it will not be therefore I charge you as you have pity stop those tender ear from his enchant voice close up those eye that you may neither catch a dart from he nor he from you I charge you as you hope to live in quiet for when I be dead for certain I shall walk to visit he if he break promise with i for as fast as oath without a formal ceremony can make i I be to he then be fearless for if he be a thing betwixt God and man I can gaze on he if I know it sin to love he without passion dry your eye I swear you shall enjoy he still for i I will not hinder you but I perceive you be not what you seem rise rise Thalestris if your right name be so Indeed it be not Spaconia be name but I desire not to be know to other why by i you shall not I will never do you wrong what good I can I will think not my birth or education such that I shall injure a strange virgin you be welcome hither in company you wish to be command but when we be alone I shall be ready to be your servant the king the king the king the king now now now now I thank you all now be my joy at full when I behold you safe my love subject by you I grow it|be your unite love that lift i to this height all the account that I can render you for all the love you have bestow on i all your expense to maintain my war be but a little word you will imagine it|be slender payment yet it|be such a word as be not to be buy without our blood it|be peace now you may live secure in your town your child round about you you may sit under your vine and make the misery of other kingdom a discourse for you and lend they sorrow for yourselves you may safe forget there be such thing as tear and may you all who good thought I have gain hold i unworthy when I think my life a sacrifice too great to keep you thus in such a calm estate see all good people I have bring the man who very name you fear a captive home behold he it|be Tigranes in your heart sing song of gladness and deliverance sir you do i wrong to render i a scorn spectacle to common people it be far from i to mean it so if I have aught deserve my love subject let i beg of you not to revile this prince in who their dwell all worth of which the nature of a man be capable valour beyond compare the terror of his name have stretch itself wherever there be sun and yet for you I fight with he single and win he too I make his valour stoop and make that name soar to so unbelieved a height to fall beneath i this inspire with all your love I do perform and will for your content be ever ready for a great work if there be any thing in which I may do good to

something a scornful look on i and ask i who I think will overcome I smile and tell he if he will fight with i he shall perceive by the event of that who king will win something he answer and a scuffle be like to grow when one Zipetus offer to help he I why yes I|will tell your grace they be not to fight till the word give which for my own part by my troth I be not to give see for his own part I fear yet this fellow|be abuse with a good report ay but I still of himself cry give the word whenas some of they say Tigranes be stoop but the word be not give then when one Cosros of the enemy part hold up his finger to i which be as much with we martialist as I will fight with you I say not a word nor make sign during the combat but that once do he slip over all the fight I call he to i
