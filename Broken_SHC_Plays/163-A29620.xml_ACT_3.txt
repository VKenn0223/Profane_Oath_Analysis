about i to show o sir I|will bring the duke own barber that shall take his oath upon a corporal book that this be a beard and no periwig I be he that be overseer of the duke work and not the fair duchess that you take i for put on your spectacle and you will see I be nothing like she o save the man save the man now he flounce now he flounder yet he swim above water like a walnut shell yet he sprawl like a naked frog yet he strive for life o save the man save the man but now now now he sink by degree now he be swallow now he be choke this be my comfort he can choose but go with a clean soul to heaven it will be so wash in the water before he come thither again again again now he lie still upon his back and float along with the tide and now his soul be in the sky he do not offer so much as to strive against the stream but swim as gentle down with the tide as may be but what a fool be he that know he shall go so long a journey by water and the weather so can too will leave his
