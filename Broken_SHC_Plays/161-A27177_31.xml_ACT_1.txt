religious zeal have wisdom with it this lady be ordain to bless the empire and we may all give thank for|it I believe you if any thing redeem the emperor from his wild fly course this be she she can instruct he if you mark she be wise too exceed wise which be a wonder in she and so religious that I well believe though she will sin she can And beside she have the empire cause in hand not love there lie the main consideration for which she be chief bear she find that point strong than we can tell she and believe it I look by her mean for a reformation and such a one and such a rare way carry that all the world shall wonder at it|be true I never think the emperor have wisdom pity or fair affection to his country till he profess this love god give|they child such as her virtue merit and his zeal I look to see a Numa from this lady or great than Octavius do you mark too which be a noble virtue how she blush and what a flow modesty run through she when we but name the emperor but mark it yes and admire it too for she consider though she be fair as heaven and virtuous as holy truth yet to the emperor she be a kind of nothing but her service which she be bind to offer and she|will do it and when her country cause command affection she know obedience be the key of virtue then fly the blush out like Cupid arrow and though the tie of marriage to her lord will fain cry stay Lucina yet the cause and general wisdom of the prince love make she find sure end and happy and if the first be chaste this be twice double her tartness unto we too that|be a wise one I rare like it show a rise wisdom that chide all common fool as dare inquire what prince will have private what a lady shall we be bless to serve go get you from i you be your purse agent not the prince be this the virtuous lore you train i out too be I a woman fit to imp your vice but that I have a mother and a woman who ever live fame turn all it touch into the good itself be I shall now even doubt myself I have be search so near the very soul of honour why shall you two that happy have be as chaste as I be fair I think by much for yet your face like ancient well build pile show worthy ruin after that angel age turn mortal devil for shame for womanhood for what you have be for rot cedar have bear goodly branch if you have hope of any heaven but court which like a dream you|will find hereafter vanish or at the best but subject to repentance study no more to be ill speak of let woman live themselves if they must fall their own destruction find they not your sevour madam you be so excellent in all and I must tell it you with admiration so true a joy you have so sweet a fear and when you come to anger it|be so noble that for my own part I can still offend to hear you angry woman that want that and your way guide else I count it nothing be either fool or coward she be a mistress for no private greatness can she not frown a ravishd kiss from anger and such a anger as this lady learn we stick with such please danger god I ask you which of you all can hold from I perceive you your own dark sin dwell with you and that price you sell the chastity of modest wife at run to disease with your bone I scorn you and all the net you have pitch to catch my virtue like spider web I sweep away before i go tell the emperor you have meet a woman that neither his own person which be godlike the world he rule nor what that world can purchase nor all the glory subject to a Cesar the honour that he offer for my body the hope gift everlasting flattery nor any thing that|be his and apt to tempt i no not to be the mother of the empire and queen of all the holy fire he worship can make a whore of you mistake we lady yet tell he this have thus much weaken i that I have here his knave and you his matron fit nurse for his sin which god forgive i but ever to be lean to his folly or to be bring to love his lust assure he and from her mouth who life shall make it certain I never can I have a noble husband pray tell he that too yet a noble name a noble family and last a conscience thus much for your answer for yourselves you have live the shame of woman die the better exit what|be now to do Lucina even as she say to die for there|be no live here and woman thus I be sure for we two Nothing stick upon she we have lose a mass of money well dame virtue yet you may halt if good luck serve worm take she she have almost spoil our trade so godly this be ill breed phorba if the woman shall have a long now to see this monster and she convert they all that may be phorba but if it be I|will have the young man geld come let|we go think she must not escape we thus there be a certain season if we hit that woman may be rid without a bit exeunt I can blame the nation noble friend that they fall off so fast from this wild man when under our allegiance be it speak and the most happy tie of our affection the world weight groan beneath he where live virtue honour discretion wisdom who be call and choose to the steer of the empire but bawd and sing girl o my aecius the glory or a soldier and the truth of man make up for goodness sake like shell grow to the ragged wall for want of action only your happy self and I that love you which be a large mean to i then favour no more my worthy friend though these be truth and though these truth will ask a reformation at least a little square yet remember we be but subject Maximus obedience to what be do and grief for what be ill do be all we can call we the heart of prince be like the temple of the god pure incense until unhallowed hand defile those offering burn ever there we must not put they out because the priest that touch those sweet be wicked we dare not dear friend nay more we can while we consider why we be and how to what law bind much more to what lawgiver while majesty be make to be obey and not inquire into while god and angel make but a rule as we do though a strict like desperate and unseasoned fool let fly our kill anger and forsake our honour my noble friend from who instruction I never yet take surfeit weigh but thus much nor think I speak it with ambition for by the god I do not why aecius why be we thus or how become thus wretched you|will fall again into your fit I will not or be we now no more the son of roman no more the follower of their happy fortune but conquer Gaul or quiver for the parthian why be this emperor this man we honour this God that ought to be you be too curious good give i leave why be this author of we I dare not hear you speak thus I|will be modest thus lead away thus vain lead away and we beholder misconceive i not I sow no danger in my word but wherefore and to what end be we the son of father famous and fast to Rome why be their virtue stamp in the danger of a thousand battle for goodness sake their honour time out dare I think for our example you speak noble why be we seed of these then to shake hand with bawd and base informer kiss discredit and court she like a mistress pray your leave yet you|will say the emperor be young and apt to take impression rather from his pleasure then any constant worthiness it may be but why do these the people call his pleasure exceed the moderation of a man nay to say just friend why be they vice and such as shake our worth with foreign nation you search the sore too deep and I must tell you in any other man this have be boldness and so reward pray depress you spirit for though I constant believe you honest you be no friend for i else and what now you free speak but good you owe tooth empire yet take heed worthy Maximus all ear hear not with that distinction my do few you|will find admonisher but urger of your action and to the heavy friend and pray consider we be but shadow motion other give we and though our pity may become the time just our power can make i worthy to be your ever friend in fair allegiance but not in force for dare my own soul urge i and by that soul I speak my just affection to turn my hand from truth which be obedience and give the helm my virtue hold to anger though I have both the blessing of the brutij and both their instigation though my cause carry a face of justice beyond they and as I be a servant to my fortune that dare soul that first teach disobedience shall feel the first example say the prince as I may well believe seem vicious who just know it|be not to try our honour or say he be a ill prince be we therefore fit fire to purge he no my dear friend the elephant be never win with anger nor must that man that will reclaim a lion take he by|the tooth I pray mistake i not our honest action and the light that break like morning from our service chaste and blush be that that pull a prince back then he see and not till then true repent his error when subject crystal soul be glass to he my ever honour friend I|will take your council the emperor appear I|will leave you to he and as we both affect he may he flourish Exit Max. yet the best we know sir bid Maximus come to i and be go then my own head be my helper these be fool how now aecius be the soldier quiet better I hope sir than they be they be please I hear to censure i extreme for my pleasure short they|will fight against i god defend sir and for their censure they be such shrewd judger a donative of ten sesterce I|will undertake shall make they ring your praise more than they sing your pleasure I believe thou be thou in love aecius yet o no sir I be too course for lady my embrace that only be acquaint with alarm will break their tender body never fear it they be strong than you think they|will hold the hammer my empress swear thou be a lusty soldier a good one I believe thou all that goodness be but your grace creature tell i true for thou dare tell i any thing concern you that|be fit for i to speak and you to pardon what say the soldier of i and the same word mince they not good aecius but deliver the very form and tongue they talk withal I|will tell your grace but with this caution you be not stir for shall the god live with we even those we certain believe be righteous give they but drink they will censure they too forward then to begin they say you sleep too much by which they judge your majesty too sensual apt to decline your strength to ease and pleasure and when you do not sleep you drink too much from which they fear suspicion first than ruin and when you neither drink nor sleep you wench much which they affirm first break your understanding then take the edge of honour make we seem that be the rib and rampire of the empire fencer and beat fool and so regard but I believe they not for be these truth your virtue can correct they they speak plain they say moreover since your grace will have it for they will talk their freedom though the sword be in their throat that of late time like Nero and with the same forgetfulness of glory you have get a vain of file so they term it some drunken dream aecius so I hope sir and that you rather study cruelty and to be fear for blood then love for bounty which make the nation as they say despise you tell your year and action by their death who truth and strength of duty make you Caesar they say beside you nourish strange devourer feed with the fat of|the empire they call bawd lazy and lustful creature that abuse you a people as they term they make of paper in which the secret sin of each man money be seal and send a work what sin|be next for I perceive they have no mind to spare i nor hurt you o my soul sir but such people nor can the power of man restrain it when they be full of meat and ease must prattle forward I have speak too much sir I|will have all it fit not your ear shall hear their vanity no profit can just rise to you from their behaviour unless you be guilty of those crime it may be I be so therefore forward I have ever learned to obey nor shall my life resist it no more apology they grieve beside sir to see the nation who our ancient virtue with many a weary march and hunger conquer with loss of many a dare life subdue fall from their fair obedience and even murmur to see the warlike eagle mew their honour in obscure town that wont to prey on prince they cry for enemy and tell the captain the fruit of Italy be luscious give we Egypt or sandy Africa to display our valour there where our sword may make we meat and danger digest our well get viand here our weapon and body that be make for shine brass be both unedge and old with ease and woman and than they cry again where be the german line with hot Spain or Gallia bring they on and let the son of war steel Mithridates lead up his wing parthian like a storm hide the face of heaven with shower of arrow yet we dare fight like roman then as soldier tire with a weary march they tell their wound even weeep ripe they be no more nor deep and glory in those scar that make they lovely and sit where a camp be like sad pilgrim they reckon up the time and live labour of Julius or Germanicus and wonder that Rome who turret once be top with honour can now forget the custom of her conquest and then they blame your grace and say who lead we shall we stand here like statue be our father the son of lazy moor our prince Persian nothing but silk and softness curse on they that first teach Nero wantonness and blood Tiberius doubt Caligula all vice for from the spring of these succeed prince thus they talk sir well why do you hear these thing why do you do they I take the god to witness with more sorrow and more vexation do I hear these tainture then be my life drop from i through a hourglass belike than you believe they or at least be glad they shall be so take heed you be better build your own tomb and run into it live then dare a prince anger I be old sir and ten year more addition be but nothing now if my life be please to you take it upon my knee if ever any service as let i brag some have be worthy notice if ever any worth or trust you give i deserve a fair respect if all my action the hazard of my youth cold burn want for you and for the empire be not vice by that style you have stamp upon i soldier let i not fall into the hand of wretch I understand you not let not this body that have look brave in his blood for Cesar and covetous of wound and for your safety after the escape of sword spear sling and arrow against which my beat body be my armour the sea and thirsty desert now be purchase for slave and base informer I see anger and death look through your eye I be mark for slaughter and know the tell of this truth have make i a man clean lose to this world I embrace it only my last petition sacred Cesar be I may die a roman rise my friend still and worthy of my love reclaim the soldier I|will study to do so upon myself too go keep your command and prosper lord Maximus attend your grace go tell he I|will meet he in the gallery the honesty of this aecius who be indeed the bulwark of the empire have dive so deep into i that of all the sin I covet but this woman beauty with much repentance now I can be quit of but she be such a pleasure be good that though I be a god she will fire my blood exit be that the best news enter the emperor and Chilax life to Cesar Exit aecius enter Chilax
