her father testament who memory I bow to leave coheir in all he stand possess of it|be confess my good Achoreus that in these eastern kingdom woman be not exempt from the sceptre but claim a privilege equal to the male but how much such division have take from the majesty of Egypt and what faction have spring from those partition to the ruin of the poor subject doubtful which to follow we have too many and too sad example therefore the wise Photinus to prevent the murder and the massacre that attend on disunited government and to show the king without a partner in full splendour think it convenient the fair Cleopatra a attribute not frequent in this climate shall be commit to safe custody in which she be attend like her birth until her beauty or her royal dowry have find she out a husband how this may stand with the rule of policy I know not most sure I be it hold no correspondence with the rite of Egypt or the law of nature but grant that Cleopatra can sit down with this disgrace though insupportable can you imagine that Rome glorious senate to who charge by the will of the dead king this government be deliver or great Pompey that be appoint Cleopatra guardian as well

pharsalian plain where Caesar with a handful of his man hem in the great number he whole troop exceed not twenty thousand but old soldier flesh in the spoil of Germany and France enure to his command and only know to fight and overcome and though that famine reign in his camp compel they to taste bread make of root forbid the use of man which they with scorn throw into Pompey camp as in derision
