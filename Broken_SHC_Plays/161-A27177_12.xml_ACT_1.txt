lead they on to fight go on still and And as if I can have be a second nature as well in hearten they by my example as by my exhortation I give life to quicken courage to inflame revenge to heighten resolution in a word to outdo action it boot not to discover how that youngman who be not fledge nor skill in martial play be even as ignorant as childish but I list not to disparage his non ability the signal give of battle when our enemy come on direct more by fury then warrant of policy and stratagem I meet they I in the forefront of the army meet they and as if this old weather-beaten body have be compose of cannon-proof I stand the volley of their shot ay I myself be he that first disrank their wood of pike but when we come to handy-stroke as often as I lend blow so often I give wound and every wound a death I may be bold to justify a truth this very sword of i slay more than any twain beside and which be not the least of all my glory when he this young man hand to hand in fight be by the general of the venetian and such as be his retinue unhorse I step between and rescue he myself or horse hoof have trample he to dirt and while he be remount I maintain the combat with the gallant general till have take breath he throng before i renew the fight and with a fatal blow steal both that honour from i and his life from he who I before myself alone have more than full three quarter kill a man well worthy only by this hand to have die not by a boy weak push I talk too much but it|be a fault of age if to bring home long peace long victory even to your Capitol if to secure your kingdom wife and child your life and liberty if to renown your honour through the world to fix your name like blaze star admire and fear by all that have but hear of candy or a Cretan be to
