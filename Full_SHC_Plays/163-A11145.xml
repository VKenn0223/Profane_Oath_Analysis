        <edition n="0.5">This text is one of  some 500 EEBO-TCP transcriptions of Early Modern plays that have undergone several routines to create an interoperable and algorithmically amenable corpus of Early Modern Drama.  Many incompletely or incorrectly transcribed words, as well as obvious printers' errors have been corrected,  but the  text has not been proofread word by word.

      <editorialDecl>
        <p>This text is derived from an EEBO-TCP text but has undergone additional curation. The following passage, quoted from the editorial declaration of the TCP header, summarize the TCP encoding and quality assurance practices, and define appropriate levels of expectation about TCP transcriptions:</p>
        <p>
          <quote>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org)...Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</quote>
        </p>
        <p>The editorial work on this project has been done  mainly by undergraduates, who have turned out to require very little training to become expert at identifying and fixing a high percentage of manifest textual defects. But  each text will require editorial attention before it could be certified as a text that meets the standards one associates with a printed text good enough for many scholarly purposes. At the minimum, each text should be proofread against its printed source or a high-quality facsimile of it. </p>
        <interpretation>
          <p>The texts were tokenized. Each token was wrapped in a <gi>w</gi> or <gi>pc</gi> element and assigned to a corpus-wide xml:id The tokens were linguistically annotated with MorphAdorner. Each token was mapped to a lemma and a part of speech tag as <att>lemma</att> and <att>ana</att> attributes. The linguistic annotation has gone through several rounds of manual review.  The estimated error rate is less than 2%. This annotation has gone </p>
          <p>The structural elements <gi>div</gi>, <gi>sp</gi>, <gi>o</gi> , <gi>l</gi>, <gi>p</gi>, <gi>note</gi> were given xml:ids in the form of a simple numerous currens incrementing by 10. </p>
          <p><gi>sp</gi> elements were marked with a <att>who</att> attribute consisting of the filename of the TCP text and a lower-case spelling of the name or role, e.g. "A00960-eustace". The <att>who</att> attributes map to map to the role_ids of an algorithmically produced castlist that gives the count of the number of speech elements for each character</p>
        </interpretation>
        <hyphenation>
          <p>The TCP transcriptions ignored linebreaks but marked hyphenated words as well as words split across lines without a hyphen. In this version such hyphen markers have been tacitly removed unless there was clear evidence that the word was a hyphenated word. </p>
        </hyphenation>
        <correction>
          <p>Incompletely and incorrectly transcribed or printed words were corrected without distinguishing between printer's or transcriber's errors. But all changes from the spellings that occur in the TCP text have been logged in something like an <foreign>apparatus criticus</foreign> at the end of each text.</p>
        </correction>
        <normalization>
          <p>Variant spellings have been mapped to standard forms using the Oxford English Dictionary as a guide. Spellings have been standardized rather than modernized.  Thus 'louyth' has been mapped to 'loveth' rather than 'loves'. The capitalization of standardized spellings has followed modern rules.  The original and standardized spellings appear in the text as alternate <gi>orig</gi> and <gi>reg</gi> children of the <gi>choice</gi> element.  This makes it easy to switch between a display in original or standardized spelling.</p>
          <p>A few typographical and orthographic features have been tacitly standardized. All instances of long 's' have been mapped to the modern form. The character 'Ʋ' (\u01b2), has been mapped to 'V'. A number of printers' abbreviations, captured in the original SGML transcriptions as character entities, have been tacitly resolved to the spellings they represent--ee.g cum&amp;abque; &gt; 'cumque'.  In some very early texts  'the' ,'that', and 'thou' are represented as 'y' followed by a superscripted 'e', 't', or 'u'. They have been tacitly resolved to 'the', 'that' and 'thou'. The same policy has been followed for the rarer instances of 'with' or 'which' spelled as 'w' followed by a superscripted 't' or 'c'. The decorations of initial characters have been ignored. </p>
        </normalization>
      </editorialDecl>
      <p>The following <gi>tagsDecl</gi> includes a few unconventional rendition elements. Some of the printers' typographical choices as well as the TCP encoding practices with regard to them are not easily squared with the requirements of a tokenized and linguistically annotated text.  For that reason <gi>hi</gi> tags and superscript notations have been expressed as rendition attributes of <gi>w</gi> elements. They are parked at the lowest level of the encoding and may be respected, ignored, or replaced. Many <gi>hi</gi> elements could be  retagged as <gi>name</gi> or <gi>foreign</gi> elements or as elements with appropriate <att>xml:id</att> or <att>rendition</att>, e.g. &lt;stage rendition="italics"&gt;. The use of <att>rendition</att> in this project is not lossy with regard to the TCP encoding, but the TCP encoding is purposely lossy and often ambiguous with regard to the typographical detail of the source texts. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections  readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-dit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber.  A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a kewyord in context.
